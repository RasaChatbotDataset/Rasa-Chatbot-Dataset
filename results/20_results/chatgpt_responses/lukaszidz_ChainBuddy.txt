REQUEST
Your task is to extract the topic/category of a Rasa chatbot. Given:
                - the repository name: ChainBuddy
                - the description: None
                - the README: # Flask API for Flow Blockchain

## Prerequisites

Before running the API, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

1. **Python**: Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.

## Running the API

Follow these steps to run the Flask API:

Navigate to the Directory: Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where your api.py file is located.

Activate a Virtual Environment (Optional): It's a good practice to create and activate a virtual environment for your project to isolate dependencies. You can create a virtual environment using virtualenv or venv.

Run the Flask Application: To start the Flask API, use the following command:

```bash
python api.py
```

The Flask development server will start, and you'll see output indicating that the server is running. By default, the API will be accessible at http://127.0.0.1:5000/.

Accessing the API: You can access the API by making HTTP requests to the specified endpoints.

GET **/account_info<account_address>**: Retrieve account information for the specified account address.

POST **/execute_transaction**: Execute a transaction by providing account information, signer key, and amount in the request body.
# Rasa Chatbot README

## Project Overview

This repository contains a chatbot powered by the Rasa framework. Rasa is an open-source natural language processing (NLP) framework for building conversational AI applications. This chatbot is designed to support with operations on the Flow blockchain.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you get started, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python (3.6+)
- Rasa (3.0+)

### Usage

1. Train your Rasa model using your training data:

```bash
   rasa train
```

2. Start the Rasa server to interact with your chatbot:

```bash
   rasa run
```

3. Start the action server. This command will start the custom action server, enabling your chatbot to perform actions and handle external events.

```bash
   rasa run actions
```
### 👋 Welcome Flow Developer!
Welcome to your new Flow project. We've created the basic folder structure you will need to develop your project and provided some examples of contracts and transactions you can modify. We've also added some of the most common contracts, transactions and scripts but feel free to just delete what you don't need. 

### 🔨 Getting started
Getting started can feel overwhelming, but we are here for you. Depending on how accustomed you are to Flow here's a list of resources you might find useful:
- **[Cadence documentation](https://developers.flow.com/cadence/language)**: here you will find language reference for Cadence, which will be the language in which you develop your smart contracts,
- **[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/?wt.mc_id=DX_841432)** and **[Cadence extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=onflow.cadence)**: we suggest using Visual Studio Code IDE for writing Cadence with the Cadence extension installed, that will give you nice syntax highlitning and additional smart features,
- **[SDKs](https://developers.flow.com/tools#sdks)**: here you will find a list of SDKs you can use to ease the interaction with Flow network (sending transactions, fetching accounts etc),
- **[Tools](https://developers.flow.com/tools#development-tools)**: development tools you can use to make your development easier, [Flowser](https://docs.flowser.dev/) can be super handy to see what's going on the blockchain while you develop


### 📦 Project Structure
Your project comes with some standard folders which have a special purpose:
- `/cadence` inside here is where your Cadence smart contracts code lives
- `/web` put your web client if needed inside this folder, remove if not needed
- `/api` put your backend code if needed inside this folder, remove if not needed
- `flow.json` configuration file for your project, you can think of it as package.json, but you don't need to worry, flow dev command will configure it for you

Inside `cadence` folder you will find:
- `/contracts` location for Cadence contracts go in this folder
- `/scripts` location for Cadence scripts goes here
- `/transactions` location for Cadence transactions goes in this folder
- `/tests` all the integration tests for your dapp and Cadence tests go into this folder


### 👨‍💻 Start Developing
After creating this project using the flow setup command you should then start the emulator by running:
```
> flow emulator --contracts
```
_we use `--contracts` flag to include more already deployed contract we can then easily import in our project._

and then start the development command by running:
```shell
> flow dev
```
After the command is started it will automatically watch any changes you make to Cadence files and make sure to continiously sync those changes on the emulator network. If you make any mistakes it will report the errors as well. Read more [about the command here](https://developers.flow.com/tools/flow-cli/super-commands)

**Importing Contracts**

When you want to import the contracts you've just created you can simply do so by writing the import statement:
```
import "Foo"
```
We will automatically find your project contract named `Foo` and handle the importing for you. 

**Deploying to specific accounts**

By default all contracts are deployed to a default account. If you want to seperate contracts to different accounts you can easily do so by creating a folder inside the contracts folder and we will create the account for you which will have the same name as the folder you just created. All the contracts inside that folder will be deployed automatically to the newly created account.

Example deploying to charlie account:

_folder structure_
```
/contracts
    Bar.cdc
    /charlie
        Foo.cdc
```

You can then import the `Foo` contract in `Bar` contract the same way as any other contract:
```
import "Foo"
```

**Included Imports**

You can already import certain common contracts we included for you, just make sure you started your emulator with the `--contracts` flag so those contracts are really deployed. The list of contracts you can import out of the box is:
- NonFungibleToken `import "NonFungibleToken"`
- FlowToken `import "FlowToken"`
- FungibleToken `import "FungibleToken"`
- FUSD `import "FUSD"`
- MetadataViews `import "MetadataViews"`
- ExampleNFT `import "ExampleNFT"`
- NFTStorefrontV2 `import "NFTStorefrontV2"`
- NFTStorefront `import "NFTStorefront"`

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
