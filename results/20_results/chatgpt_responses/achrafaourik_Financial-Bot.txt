## ‚ÑπÔ∏è About
In this project, you will find a chatbot that is capable of **creating bank accounts**, **checking their balance** and **performing transactions** on these accounts. It is also capable of doing other non-financial related tasks such as **answering FAQ questions** and **chitchat** with users.

Such feats have been achieved by using the  following frameworks:
- `rasa` for the **Natural Language Processing** part of the project which is responsible for the **intent classification** (predict what the user **intends** to say) as well as `entity` and `slot` **filling** (collect the information required from the user to complete certain tasks).
- `django` as the **backend** of the project which helped to create multiple **API endpoints** to fetch (using **GET** requests) bank accounts data and also to create bank accounts and performing transactions (using **POST** requests). All of these requests are made using **Token Authentication** and the results are filtered for the authenticated user.
- `nginx` which serves both of the following functions:
    - **load balancer** for intelligently routing incoming requests to the available workers.
    - **serving static files**.
- `gunicorn` used as a **web server** as an interface between `django` and `nginx` that processes the **HTTP** requests between these two.
- `postgresql` used as a **database server** for storing users data.
- `docker` used for creating a **standardized environment** which ensures that all dependencies, code and libraries are the same across all containers made using the same `Dockerfile`.
- `docker-compose` which allows to **define and spin multiple containers**  at once and have them **share the same network** interface.

This is all summarized in the following graph:

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Prerequisites

In order to be able to work with this project, `Docker` and `docker-compose` have to be installed on the host machine.

### Install Docker

The official [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) provides enough details to properly install `Docker` on your operating system. Please note that `docker-compose` should also be installed too.


## ‚ö° Quick Setup

### Development Version Build
In order to run the development build (without nginx), run the following command:
```
docker-compose up --build
```

You can then access the bot locally by going to the following address: <a href="http://localhost:9000/bot/index">http://localhost:9000/bot/index</a>

### Deployment Version Build
In order to run the development build (using nginx), run the following command:

```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up --build
```

You can then access the bot locally by going to the following address: <a href="http://localhost:1337/bot/index">http://localhost:1337/bot/index</a>

‚ö†Ô∏è Please note: it takes about 2 minutes for the project to start running properly.
