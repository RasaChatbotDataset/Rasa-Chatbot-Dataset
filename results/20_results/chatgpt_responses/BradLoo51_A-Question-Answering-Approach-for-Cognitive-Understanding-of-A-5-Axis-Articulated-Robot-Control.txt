Your task is to extract the topic/category of a Rasa chatbot. Given:
                - the repository name: A-Question-Answering-Approach-for-Cognitive-Understanding-of-A-5-Axis-Articulated-Robot-Control
                - the description: None
                - the README: # A-Question-Answering-Approach-for-Cognitive-Understanding-of-A-5-Axis-Articulated-Robot-Control

This is my undergraduate Final Year Project.

**Note that the movement control code in the repository is adjusted to my prototype due to several hardware limitations on the robotic arm such as the imprecise angle of the robotic arm frame due to the weight of the servo motor. Hence, the accuracy of the robotic arm in successfully locating its end effector to the desired coordinate varies, and some adjustments on the code would be needed to the movement control and working envelope.**

### Overview:
This project focuses on making a robotic arm to be a personal assistant. The concept is to develop a cognitive understanding for the robotic arm to understand the users intent through their commands, which can be an abstract or direct commands. From the commands, the robotic arm will execute the desired programmed actions to assist the user. It utilizes four different field of AI implementation: Artificial Neural Network, Speech Recognition, Natural Language Processing, and Computer Vision. A prototype is build with the aforementioned implementation with some Robotic Engineering to showcase the use case of the project.

### Prototype:

Materials used:
- Arduino UNO Maker
- Raspberry Pi 3B+
- 5 DoF Robotic Arm
- A Full HD Web Camera
- Sugus Candies (Blackcurrant, Orange, and Strawberry)
- 1oz (30ml) Paper Sampling Cups
- 6 180-Degree Servo Motors

Currently, the robotic arm is programmed to perform 3 tasks:
- Picking up a small cup
- Picking up a sugus candy
- Sorting the sugus candies

The diagram above showcases the general setup to utilize the code
</p>

The ServoControl folder contains the code for the Arduino to receive serial communication from the Raspberry Pi and control the servo motors. The **main.py** in the Raspberry Pi folder should be executed first to allow it to connect with the Arduino and boot up the Yolov8 model. When the **main.py** finishes booting up, it will awaits for a connection from the computer's side before initializing the camera readings. The Chatbot-RASA folder contains all the necessary components to initialize the whole process.

Steps from the computer's side:
1. Open up two terminals in your source-code editor (VSCode)
2. Execute **rasa run actions** on one of the terminals (This will run a localhost server which will create a communication to the Raspberry Pi and handle all the actions that needs to be executed)
3. Execute **rasa run** on the other terminal (This will boot up the RASA Core model on a localhost server)
4. Finally, execute the **start.py** file to initialize the Speech Recognition modules where it will awaits specific keywords (Alexa or computer) before it starts detecting the voice commands

                - the list of intents: ['get_cup', 'inform', 'pick_candy', 'sort_candy', 'stop', 'out_of_scope']
                - the list of entities: ['flavour']
                - the list of actions: ['action_reset_candy_slot', 'validate_simple_pick_form', 'validate_simple_sort_form', 'action_sort_candy', 'action_pick_candy', 'action_pick_cup']
                Select the topic of the chatbot considering this list of topics: ['Art & Design', 'Auto & Vehicles', 'Android Wear', 'Beauty', 'Books & Reference', 'Business', 'Comics', 'Communication', 'Dating', 'Education', 'Entertainment', 'Events', 'Finance', 'Food & Drink', 'Health & Fitness', 'House & Home', 'Libraries & Demo', 'Lifestyle', 'Maps & Navigation', 'Medical', 'Music & Audio', 'News & Magazines', 'Parenting', 'Personalization', 'Photography', 'Productivity', 'Shopping', 'Social', 'Sports', 'Tools', 'Travel & Local', 'Video Players & Editors', 'Watch Face', 'Weather', 'Games']. If the chatbot's topic matches one of these, use the topic in the list. Otherwise define a new topic. 
                Answer only with the topic, with no further words.
