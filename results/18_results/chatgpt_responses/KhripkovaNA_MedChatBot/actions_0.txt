Problem: This is a python actions.py file of Rasa chatbot from typing import Any, Text, Dict, List
import pandas as pd
import os
from rasa_sdk import Action, Tracker
from rasa_sdk.executor import CollectingDispatcher
from rasa_sdk.events import SlotSet


FILE_DIR = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
DATA_PATH = os.path.join(FILE_DIR, 'data', 'diseases_db.csv')

# Load the diseases.csv file into a pandas DataFrame
df = pd.read_csv(DATA_PATH)

class ActionProvideDiseaseInfo(Action):

    def name(self) -> Text:
        return "action_provide_disease_info"

    def run(self, dispatcher: CollectingDispatcher,
            tracker: Tracker,
            domain: Dict[Text, Any]) -> List[Dict[Text, Any]]:

        # Extract the user's entity from the tracker
        inquired_disease = tracker.get_slot("disease")

        if not inquired_disease:
            dispatcher.utter_message(text="What disease are you interested in?")
            return []

        # Search for the disease in the DataFrame based on the user's query
        disease_info = df[df["Disease"].str.contains(inquired_disease, case=False)]

        if not disease_info.empty:

            # Check if symptoms_info and treatment_info slots have values
            symptoms_info = tracker.get_slot('symptoms_info')
            treatment_info = tracker.get_slot('treatment_info')

            if symptoms_info:

                response = f"The symptoms of {inquired_disease} are:"
                response += f"\n{symptoms}"
                dispatcher.utter_message(text=response)
                return [SlotSet("symptoms_info", None)]

            if treatment_info:
                treatment = disease_info['Treatments'].values[0]
                response = f"The treatment options for {inquired_disease} include:"
                response += f"\n{treatment}"

                return [SlotSet("treatment_info", None)]

            # Extract the relevant information from the DataFrame
            response = disease_info["Description"].values[0]
            # Send the response to the user
            dispatcher.utter_message(text=f"Here is some information about {inquired_disease}:\n{response}")

        else:
            dispatcher.utter_message(text="I'm sorry, I couldn't find information about that disease. Is it spelled correctly?")

        return []

 
        Does the chatbot use any database (local or external) or any external service? Answer with a list of these databases and services (only names on a single line, no further explanation, no numeration). 
        
    For this problem I received these answers, each with a list of services:
    pandas, diseases_db.csv
pandas, diseases_db.csv
pandas, diseases_db.csv
pandas, diseases_db.csv
diseases_db.csv
diseases_db.csv
pandas, diseases_db.csv
pandas
pandas, diseases_db.csv
pandas, diseases_db.csv
    Basing on these answers and on the action file written in the problem, write one complete and correct list of the external services used in this action file. Keep in mind that some answers may have incorrect terms which are not external services or databases (like libraries that are not external services, or services that do not exist) and you have to remove them. 
    Different answers may refer to the same service with different names, and there could be missing services that you have to add.
    Write this list of service names on a single line, with no introduction, further explanation or numeration, so like this:
    Service1, Service2, Service3 
    In a new section titled "Purpose of external services" explain the purpose of each service.
    If the file doesn't use any external service nor database, answer only with "NO" and nothing else

RESPONSE
diseases_db.csv

Purpose of external services:
- diseases_db.csv: This is a local database file that contains information about various diseases, including their symptoms, treatments, and descriptions. The chatbot uses this file to provide users with relevant information about diseases they inquire about.
