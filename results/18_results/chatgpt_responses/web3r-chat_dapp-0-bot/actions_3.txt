Problem: This is a python actions.py file of Rasa chatbot """Reads settings from environment variables and sets default values.

  Define as repository secrets in GitHub repository, under Settings

Production deployment as Digital Ocean App:
  Define as environment variables in DO App's Dashboard, under Settings

        Does the chatbot use any database (local or external) or any external service? Answer with a list of these databases and services (only names on a single line, no further explanation, no numeration). 
        
    For this problem I received these answers, each with a list of services:
    Digital Ocean, IC Network,,###
External services: IC_NETWORK_URL, CANISTER_MOTOKO_CANDID_UI
IC_NETWORK_URL, CANISTER_MOTOKO_CANDID_UI
Digital Ocean, IC Network
Digital Ocean, IC Network
Digital Ocean, IC Network
Digital Ocean, IC Network
Digital Ocean, IC Network,,###
Digital Ocean, IC Network
Databases and services: IC_NETWORK_URL, CANISTER_MOTOKO_ID, CANISTER_MOTOKO_CANDID_UI
    Basing on these answers and on the action file written in the problem, write one complete and correct list of the external services used in this action file. Keep in mind that some answers may have incorrect terms which are not external services or databases (like libraries that are not external services, or services that do not exist) and you have to remove them. 
    Different answers may refer to the same service with different names, and there could be missing services that you have to add.
    Write this list of service names on a single line, with no introduction, further explanation or numeration, so like this:
    Service1, Service2, Service3 
    In a new section titled "Purpose of external services" explain the purpose of each service.
    If the file doesn't use any external service nor database, answer only with "NO" and nothing else

RESPONSE
IC Network, Digital Ocean, CANISTER_MOTOKO_CANDID_UI

Purpose of external services:
- IC Network: Used for interacting with the Internet Computer network.
- Digital Ocean: Used for production deployment and hosting of the chatbot.
- CANISTER_MOTOKO_CANDID_UI: Used for accessing the user interface of the Motoko canister on the Internet Computer.
