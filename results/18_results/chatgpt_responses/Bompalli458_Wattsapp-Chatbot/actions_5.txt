Problem: This is a python actions.py file of Rasa chatbot from typing import Any, Text, Dict, List, Union

import requests
from rasa_sdk import Action, Tracker
from rasa_sdk.executor import CollectingDispatcher
from rasa_sdk.events import SlotSet

class PersonalLoanStatus(Action):
    """Form action for collecting personal loan status information."""

    def name(self) -> Text:
        return "action_personal_loan_status"

    def run(
            self,
            dispatcher: CollectingDispatcher,
            tracker: Tracker,
            domain: Dict[Text, Any],
    ) -> List[Dict[Text, Any]]:

        # Check if the form is active and slots are filled

        else:
            dispatcher.utter_message(text="Sorry, an error occurred while retrieving the loan status. Please try again later.")

        Does the chatbot use any database (local or external) or any external service? Answer with a list of these databases and services (only names on a single line, no further explanation, no numeration). 
        
    For this problem I received these answers, each with a list of services:
    Databases and services: requests, http://localhost:8058/efundzz/personalloan/status
Databases and services: requests, http://localhost:8058/efundzz/personalloan/status
Databases and services: localhost:8058/efundzz
Databases and services: localhost:8058
Databases and services: localhost:8058
Databases and services: localhost:8058
Databases and services: requests, http://localhost:8058/efundzz/personalloan/status
External services: requests
Databases and services: localhost:8058
requests
    Basing on these answers and on the action file written in the problem, write one complete and correct list of the external services used in this action file. Keep in mind that some answers may have incorrect terms which are not external services or databases (like libraries that are not external services, or services that do not exist) and you have to remove them. 
    Different answers may refer to the same service with different names, and there could be missing services that you have to add.
    Write this list of service names on a single line, with no introduction, further explanation or numeration, so like this:
    Service1, Service2, Service3 
    In a new section titled "Purpose of external services" explain the purpose of each service.
    If the file doesn't use any external service nor database, answer only with "NO" and nothing else

RESPONSE
localhost:8058

Purpose of external services:
localhost:8058 - This service is used to retrieve the personal loan status information based on the provided phone number.
