## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:


**1. Clone the Repository**
Begin by cloning the repository to your local machine:
```
https://github.com/langchain-tech/rasa-bot.git
cd rasa-bot
```

**2. Create a Virtual Environment**
It is recommended to create a virtual environment to manage dependencies:
```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

**3. Install Dependencies**
Install the necessary packages listed in the requirements.txt file:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```



**4. Start the Application**

Train your Rasa model
```
rasa train
```


## Method to interaact with Rasa bot
**1. Interact using terminal**


In one terminal, run the following command to start the Rasa action server:
```
rasa run actions
```
This command will start the action server, which is responsible for handling custom actions defined in your Rasa project.

In the second terminal, run the following command to start the Rasa shell:
```
rasa shell
```
This command will start an interactive chat interface where you can communicate with your Rasa bot.

Once both servers are running, you can start interacting with your Rasa bot in the shell.



**2. Interact with your Rasa bot in whatsapp using twilio**
1. In one terminal, run the following command to start the Rasa action server:
```
rasa run actions
```
This command will start the action server, which is responsible for handling custom actions defined in your Rasa project.

2. Start your Rasa server by running:
```
rasa run
```
This command will start the Rasa server, allowing it to receive messages and respond accordingly.


3. Use ngrok for Port Forwarding: Ngrok will help you expose your local server to the internet so that Twilio can communicate with it. Run ngrok with the following command:

```
ngrok http 5005
```
This command will create a publicly accessible URL forwarding requests to your local Rasa server.

4. **Set up Twilio**: Sign up for a Twilio account if you haven't already. Once you're logged in, navigate to the Twilio console.

5. **Set Up WhatsApp Integration**: Follow Twilio's instructions to set up a WhatsApp integration. You'll need to verify your phone number and configure a webhook URL.

6. **Configure Webhook URL**: Set the ngrok URL you received in step 3 as the webhook URL in your Twilio console. Make sure to append /webhooks/twilio/webhook to the end of the URL to ensure Twilio routes messages correctly to Rasa.

7. **Test Your Bot**: Once everything is set up, you can start sending messages to your Twilio WhatsApp number. Twilio will forward these messages to your Rasa server via ngrok, and your Rasa bot will respond accordingly.

With these steps completed, you should be able to interact with your Rasa bot via WhatsApp using Twilio as the messaging platform.
