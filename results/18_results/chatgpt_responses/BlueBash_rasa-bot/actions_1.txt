REQUEST
Problem: This is a python actions.py file of Rasa chatbot import os
import pandas as pd
import json
import logging
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()
HOME_DIR = os.getenv("HOME_DIR")
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

import pdb


def extract_rows_excel(email: str):
  file_path = f"{HOME_DIR}/actions/data/dummy_data_200_rows.csv"
  df = pd.read_csv(file_path)
  matching_rows = df[df['Email'] == email]
  logger.info(matching_rows)
  matching_rows_json = matching_rows.to_json(orient='records')  
  matching_rows_dict = json.loads(matching_rows_json)
  logger.info(matching_rows_dict)
  return matching_rows_dict


def extract_name_from_excel(email: str):
    matching_rows = extract_rows_excel(email)
    if matching_rows:
        first_name = matching_rows[0]['First Name']
        last_name = matching_rows[0]['Last Name']
        return f"{first_name} {last_name}"
    else:
        return None 
        Does the chatbot use any database (local or external) or any external service? Answer with a list of these databases and services (only names on a single line, no further explanation, no numeration). 
        
    For this problem I received these answers, each with a list of services:
    Databases and services: dummy_data_200_rows.csv
dummy_data_200_rows.csv
dummy_data_200_rows.csv
pandas, json, logging, dotenv
dummy_data_200_rows.csv
pandas, json, logging, dotenv
Databases and services: dummy_data_200_rows.csv
pandas, json, logging, dotenv
pandas, json, logging, dotenv
dummy_data_200_rows.csv
    Basing on these answers and on the action file written in the problem, write one complete and correct list of the external services used in this action file. Keep in mind that some answers may have incorrect terms which are not external services or databases (like libraries that are not external services, or services that do not exist) and you have to remove them. 
    Different answers may refer to the same service with different names, and there could be missing services that you have to add.
    Write this list of service names on a single line, with no introduction, further explanation or numeration, so like this:
    Service1, Service2, Service3 
    In a new section titled "Purpose of external services" explain the purpose of each service.
    If the file doesn't use any external service nor database, answer only with "NO" and nothing else

RESPONSE
dummy_data_200_rows.csv

Purpose of external services:
dummy_data_200_rows.csv: This is a local CSV file used as a database to store and retrieve data based on the user's email.
