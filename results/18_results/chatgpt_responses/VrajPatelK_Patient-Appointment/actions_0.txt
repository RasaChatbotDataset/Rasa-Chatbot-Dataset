Problem: This is a python actions.py file of Rasa chatbot import smtplib
from email.mime.text import MIMEText
from email.mime.multipart import MIMEMultipart

import random


def send_email(sender_email, sender_password, recipient_email, subject, message):
    # Create a multipart message
    msg = MIMEMultipart()
    msg['From'] = sender_email
    msg['To'] = recipient_email
    msg['Subject'] = subject

    # Add the message to the body of the email
    msg.attach(MIMEText(message, 'plain'))

    try:
        # Create a secure connection with the SMTP server
        server = smtplib.SMTP('smtp.gmail.com', 587)
        server.starttls()
        # Login to the sender's email account
        server.login(sender_email, sender_password)
        # Send the email
        server.send_message(msg)
        print("Email sent successfully")
    except Exception as e:
        print("An error occurred while sending the email:", str(e))
    finally:
        # Close the connection to the SMTP server
        server.quit()


# Example usage
def sendOtpMail(recipient_email):
    otp = str(random.randint(100000, 999999))
    sender_email = 'abzxy50312@gmail.com'  # you can use your email instead
    sender_password = 'dnbmivtzqiuqsmbf'  # change as per your gmail app-password
    # https://youtu.be/iGPPhzhXBFg  youtube video link to generate password for your email  
    subject = 'OTP for ChatBot'
    message = 'Your OTP is '+otp
    print("Sending...")
    send_email(sender_email, sender_password, recipient_email, subject, message)
    return otp
# sendMail("dhruv20345@gmail.com")
 
        Does the chatbot use any database (local or external) or any external service? Answer with a list of these databases and services (only names on a single line, no further explanation, no numeration). 
        
    For this problem I received these answers, each with a list of services:
    smtplib, email.mime.text, email.mime.multipart
smtplib, email.mime.text, email.mime.multipart, random
smtplib, email.mime.text, email.mime.multipart
smtplib, email.mime.text, email.mime.multipart
smtplib, email.mime.text, email.mime.multipart
smtplib, email.mime.text, email.mime.multipart
smtplib, email.mime.text, email.mime.multipart
smtplib, email.mime.text, email.mime.multipart
smtplib, email.mime.text, email.mime.multipart
smtplib, email.mime.text, email.mime.multipart
    Basing on these answers and on the action file written in the problem, write one complete and correct list of the external services used in this action file. Keep in mind that some answers may have incorrect terms which are not external services or databases (like libraries that are not external services, or services that do not exist) and you have to remove them. 
    Different answers may refer to the same service with different names, and there could be missing services that you have to add.
    Write this list of service names on a single line, with no introduction, further explanation or numeration, so like this:
    Service1, Service2, Service3 
    In a new section titled "Purpose of external services" explain the purpose of each service.
    If the file doesn't use any external service nor database, answer only with "NO" and nothing else

RESPONSE
smtplib, Gmail SMTP server

Purpose of external services:
- smtplib: This is a Python library used to send emails using the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP).
- Gmail SMTP server: This is the SMTP server provided by Gmail, used to send emails from a Gmail account.
