Problem: This is a python actions.py file of Rasa chatbot """
https://brightsky.dev/docs/#/operations/getWeather#response-body
"""

from dataclasses import dataclass
from datetime import datetime

from .weather_condition import WeatherCondition


@dataclass(frozen=True)
class WeatherInfo:
    """Dataclass representing weather information."""

    timestamp: datetime
    source_id: int
    cloud_cover: float | None = None
    condition: WeatherCondition | None = None
    dew_point: float | None = None
    icon: str | None = None
    precipitation: float | None = None
    precipitation_probability: int | None = None
    precipitation_probability_6h: int | None = None

        Does the chatbot use any database (local or external) or any external service? Answer with a list of these databases and services (only names on a single line, no further explanation, no numeration). 
        
    For this problem I received these answers, each with a list of services:
    BrightSky
Bright Sky API
Bright Sky API
Bright Sky API
BrightSky
BrightSky
BrightSky
BrightSky
BrightSky
BrightSky
    Basing on these answers and on the action file written in the problem, write one complete and correct list of the external services used in this action file. Keep in mind that some answers may have incorrect terms which are not external services or databases (like libraries that are not external services, or services that do not exist) and you have to remove them. 
    Different answers may refer to the same service with different names, and there could be missing services that you have to add.
    Write this list of service names on a single line, with no introduction, further explanation or numeration, so like this:
    Service1, Service2, Service3 
    In a new section titled "Purpose of external services" explain the purpose of each service.
    If the file doesn't use any external service nor database, answer only with "NO" and nothing else

RESPONSE
Bright Sky API

Purpose of external services:
Bright Sky API: This service is used to fetch weather information such as temperature, precipitation, wind speed, and other weather-related data.
