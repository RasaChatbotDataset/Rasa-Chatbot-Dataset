REQUEST
Problem: This is a python actions.py file of Rasa chatbot from typing import Any, Text, Dict, List
from rasa_sdk import Action, Tracker
from rasa_sdk.executor import CollectingDispatcher
import requests
import subprocess
from SPARQLWrapper import SPARQLWrapper, JSON
import json
import csv

# actions.py
from custom_actions.action_get_temperature import ActionGetTemperature
from custom_actions.action_give_report import ActionGiveReport
from custom_actions.action_asked_entities import ActionAskedEntities


class MyCustomActions:
    def __init__(self):
        self.action_get_temperature = ActionGetTemperature()
        self.action_give_report = ActionGiveReport()
        self.action_asked_entities = ActionAskedEntities() 
        Does the chatbot use any database (local or external) or any external service? Answer with a list of these databases and services (only names on a single line, no further explanation, no numeration). 
        
    For this problem I received these answers, each with a list of services:
    SPARQLWrapper, JSON, requests, subprocess
SPARQLWrapper, JSON, requests
SPARQLWrapper, JSON, requests, subprocess
SPARQLWrapper, JSON, requests, csv
SPARQLWrapper, JSON, requests
SPARQLWrapper, JSON, requests, csv
SPARQLWrapper, JSON, requests, subprocess
SPARQLWrapper, JSON, requests
SPARQLWrapper, JSON, requests, subprocess
SPARQLWrapper, JSON, requests, subprocess
    Basing on these answers and on the action file written in the problem, write one complete and correct list of the external services used in this action file. Keep in mind that some answers may have incorrect terms which are not external services or databases (like libraries that are not external services, or services that do not exist) and you have to remove them. 
    Different answers may refer to the same service with different names, and there could be missing services that you have to add.
    Write this list of service names on a single line, with no introduction, further explanation or numeration, so like this:
    Service1, Service2, Service3 
    In a new section titled "Purpose of external services" explain the purpose of each service.
    If the file doesn't use any external service nor database, answer only with "NO" and nothing else

RESPONSE
SPARQLWrapper, requests

Purpose of external services:
- SPARQLWrapper: Used to query and retrieve data from SPARQL endpoints, which are interfaces to databases that store data in RDF format.
- requests: Used to send HTTP requests to external APIs or services to fetch data or perform actions.
