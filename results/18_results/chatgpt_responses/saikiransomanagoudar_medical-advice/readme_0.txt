## Installation Instructions

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)

### Steps to Install
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/saikiransomanagoudar/medical-advice
   cd medical-advice
2. Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate   # On Mac: source venv/bin/activate
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Train the NLU and Core models:
   ```bash
   rasa train
5. Run the chatbot:
   ```bash
   rasa run
6. Start the action server:
   ```bash
   rasa run actions

### Usage
* To interact with the chatbot, use the Rasa shell:
  ```bash
  rasa shell
* For web or app integration, configure the endpoints.yml file and deploy on a server.


        Does the chatbot use any database (local or external) or any external service? Answer with a list of these databases and services (only names on a single line, no further explanation, no numeration). 
        
    For this problem I received these answers, each with a list of services:
    None
None
None
None
None
None
None
None
None
None
    Basing on these answers and on the action file written in the problem, write one complete and correct list of the external services used in this action file. Keep in mind that some answers may have incorrect terms which are not external services or databases (like libraries that are not external services, or services that do not exist) and you have to remove them. 
    Different answers may refer to the same service with different names, and there could be missing services that you have to add.
    Write this list of service names on a single line, with no introduction, further explanation or numeration, so like this:
    Service1, Service2, Service3 
    In a new section titled "Purpose of external services" explain the purpose of each service.
    If the file doesn't use any external service nor database, answer only with "NO" and nothing else

RESPONSE
NO
