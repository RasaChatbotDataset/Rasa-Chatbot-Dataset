This guide will walk you through the steps to set up the projects.ai chatbot on your local machine using Rasa.

## Prerequisites

- Ensure you have Python version 3.8.0 installed. If not, you can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-380/).

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Setting Up the Environment

1. Install Python version 3.8.0.
```bash
# Download and install from https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-380/
```

2. Create a new virtual environment.
```bash
python -m venv venv_rasa
```

3. Activate the virtual environment.
For Windows:
```bash
.\venv_rasa\Scripts\activate
```
For Linux/Mac:
```bash
source venv_rasa/bin/activate
```

4. Install Rasa.
```bash
pip install rasa
```

### 2. Training and Testing the Model

5. Train the chatbot model.
```bash
rasa train
```

6. Test the trained model.
```bash
rasa shell
```

### 3. Running the Servers

1. To run the website:
```bash
rasa run --enable-api --cors "*"
```

2. To run the actions:
```bash
rasa run actions
```

## Additional Resources

For a deeper dive and more configurations, refer to the official Rasa documentation: [https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/).
        Does the chatbot use any database (local or external) or any external service? Answer with a list of these databases and services (only names on a single line, no further explanation, no numeration). 
        
    For this problem I received these answers, each with a list of services:
    None
None
None
None
None
None
None
None
None
None
    Basing on these answers and on the action file written in the problem, write one complete and correct list of the external services used in this action file. Keep in mind that some answers may have incorrect terms which are not external services or databases (like libraries that are not external services, or services that do not exist) and you have to remove them. 
    Different answers may refer to the same service with different names, and there could be missing services that you have to add.
    Write this list of service names on a single line, with no introduction, further explanation or numeration, so like this:
    Service1, Service2, Service3 
    In a new section titled "Purpose of external services" explain the purpose of each service.
    If the file doesn't use any external service nor database, answer only with "NO" and nothing else

RESPONSE
NO
