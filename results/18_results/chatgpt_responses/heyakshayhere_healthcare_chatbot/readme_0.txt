## Workflow

    https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/installation/
- Create a fork 
- Create virtual environment using anaconda 
-  install rasa as well as rasa x
- And start working on it 
- Once you done! Make a folder of your name and add your whole work over there 


## Approach 

- First train the model 
- Then we will add custom indent and actions 
- Also, we will edit the stories based on how we need the bot according to the requirements 
- You can take the reference of the previous batch work

        Does the chatbot use any database (local or external) or any external service? Answer with a list of these databases and services (only names on a single line, no further explanation, no numeration). 
        
    For this problem I received these answers, each with a list of services:
    None
None
None
None
None
None
None
None
None
None
    Basing on these answers and on the action file written in the problem, write one complete and correct list of the external services used in this action file. Keep in mind that some answers may have incorrect terms which are not external services or databases (like libraries that are not external services, or services that do not exist) and you have to remove them. 
    Different answers may refer to the same service with different names, and there could be missing services that you have to add.
    Write this list of service names on a single line, with no introduction, further explanation or numeration, so like this:
    Service1, Service2, Service3 
    In a new section titled "Purpose of external services" explain the purpose of each service.
    If the file doesn't use any external service nor database, answer only with "NO" and nothing else

RESPONSE
NO
