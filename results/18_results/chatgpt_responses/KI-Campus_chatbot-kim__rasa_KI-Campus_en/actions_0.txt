Problem: This is a python actions.py file of Rasa chatbot from typing import Dict, Optional

import yaml
import os


def load_config(file_name: str, relative_dir_path: Optional[str] = None) -> Dict[str, Dict[str, any]]:
	"""
	load YAML with dictionary-like structure at its root

	:param file_name: the file name for the YAML file (including its file extension)
	:param relative_dir_path: OPTIONAL the subdirectory, relative the root directory
										(if omitted, file is assumed to be in the rasa-project's root directory)
	:return: the load YAML data
	"""
	target_dir = os.path.join('..', relative_dir_path) if relative_dir_path else '..'
	response_texts_path = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), target_dir, file_name)
	with open(response_texts_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:

def get_recommender_config() -> Dict[str, str]:
	"""
	HELPER load the configuration for the (DFKI) recommender API (entry for "recommender_api" in file kic_recommender.yml)

	"""
	recommender_config: Dict[str, Dict[str, str]] = load_config('kic_recommender.yml')

        Does the chatbot use any database (local or external) or any external service? Answer with a list of these databases and services (only names on a single line, no further explanation, no numeration). 
        
    For this problem I received these answers, each with a list of services:
    kic_recommender.yml
kic_recommender.yml
kic_recommender.yml
kic_recommender.yml
kic_recommender.yml
kic_recommender.yml
kic_recommender.yml
DFKI recommender API,,###
kic_recommender.yml,,###
kic_recommender.yml
    Basing on these answers and on the action file written in the problem, write one complete and correct list of the external services used in this action file. Keep in mind that some answers may have incorrect terms which are not external services or databases (like libraries that are not external services, or services that do not exist) and you have to remove them. 
    Different answers may refer to the same service with different names, and there could be missing services that you have to add.
    Write this list of service names on a single line, with no introduction, further explanation or numeration, so like this:
    Service1, Service2, Service3 
    In a new section titled "Purpose of external services" explain the purpose of each service.
    If the file doesn't use any external service nor database, answer only with "NO" and nothing else

RESPONSE
DFKI recommender API

Purpose of external services:
DFKI recommender API: This service is used to provide course recommendations based on the configuration specified in the kic_recommender.yml file. It includes the base URL and access token for the course-recommender endpoint.
