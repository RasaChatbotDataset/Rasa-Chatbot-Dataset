REQUEST
Problem: This is a python actions.py file of Rasa chatbot import face_recognition
import os
import numpy as np

path = 'source'

# Load pictures from folder and learn how to recognise them.
encodings = {} # {'Name': encoding}
if os.path.isdir(path):
    print("Loading known face image(s)")

    for file in os.listdir(path):
        # One person per image
        name = file.rpartition('.')[0]
        image = face_recognition.load_image_file(os.path.join(path, file))
        encoding = face_recognition.face_encodings(image)[0]
        encodings[name] = encoding

    print('Images encoded.')
else:
    raise FileNotFoundError('Source directory does not exist. Check path.')

# While the pickle module used in this function poses security flaws, this doesn't really matter.
# The main thing is that no precision is lost, while the conversion to list for JSON might.
np.save(os.path.join(path, 'encodings.npy'), encodings) 
        Does the chatbot use any database (local or external) or any external service? Answer with a list of these databases and services (only names on a single line, no further explanation, no numeration). 
        
    For this problem I received these answers, each with a list of services:
    face_recognition, numpy, os
Databases and services:,- face_recognition,- numpy,- os
face_recognition, numpy, os
face_recognition, numpy, os
face_recognition,numpy,os
face_recognition, numpy, os
face_recognition, numpy, os
face_recognition, numpy, os
face_recognition, numpy
face_recognition, numpy, os
    Basing on these answers and on the action file written in the problem, write one complete and correct list of the external services used in this action file. Keep in mind that some answers may have incorrect terms which are not external services or databases (like libraries that are not external services, or services that do not exist) and you have to remove them. 
    Different answers may refer to the same service with different names, and there could be missing services that you have to add.
    Write this list of service names on a single line, with no introduction, further explanation or numeration, so like this:
    Service1, Service2, Service3 
    In a new section titled "Purpose of external services" explain the purpose of each service.
    If the file doesn't use any external service nor database, answer only with "NO" and nothing else

RESPONSE
face_recognition, numpy

Purpose of external services:
- face_recognition: Used to load images and encode facial features for recognition.
- numpy: Used to save the encoded facial features into a .npy file for later use.
