Problem: This is a python actions.py file of Rasa chatbot import face_recognition
import picamera
import numpy as np

class FaceRecognitionModule:
    
    def __init__(self):
        # Load encodings. allow_pickle=True is a security flaw, but is not relevant.
        source = 'source/encodings.npy'
        self.base_encodings = np.load(source, allow_pickle=True).item()

        # Get a reference to the Raspberry Pi camera.
        # If this fails, make sure you have a camera connected to the RPi and that you
        # enabled your camera in raspi-config and rebooted first.
        self.camera = picamera.PiCamera()
        self.camera.resolution = (320, 240)

    # Takes the current frame of video from the camera and detects faces in it.
    def detect_faces(self):
        output = np.empty((240, 320, 3), dtype=np.uint8)

        # Initialize some variables
        face_locations = []
        face_encodings = []
        faces = []

        print("Capturing image.")
        # Grab a single frame of video from the RPi camera as a numpy array
        self.camera.capture(output, format="rgb")

        # Find all the faces and face encodings in the current frame of video
        face_locations = face_recognition.face_locations(output)
        print("Found {} faces in image.".format(len(face_locations)))
        face_encodings = face_recognition.face_encodings(output, face_locations)

        # Loop over each face found in the frame to see if it's someone we know.
        for face_encoding in face_encodings:
            # See if the face is a match for the known face(s)
            match = face_recognition.compare_faces(self.base_encodings.values(), face_encoding)
            name = "<Unknown Person>"

            if any(match):
                name = (self.base_encodings.keys()[np.where(match)[0]])

            faces.append(name)

        return faces

             
        Does the chatbot use any database (local or external) or any external service? Answer with a list of these databases and services (only names on a single line, no further explanation, no numeration). 
        
    For this problem I received these answers, each with a list of services:
    source/encodings.npy, Raspberry Pi camera, face_recognition
Databases and services: face_recognition, picamera, numpy
Raspberry Pi Camera, face_recognition
Databases and services: face_recognition, picamera, numpy
Raspberry Pi Camera, face_recognition library
source/encodings.npy, Raspberry Pi camera, face_recognition
Databases and services: face_recognition, picamera, numpy
source/encodings.npy, Raspberry Pi Camera, face_recognition library, picamera library
Raspberry Pi Camera, face_recognition
Databases and services: face_recognition, picamera, numpy
    Basing on these answers and on the action file written in the problem, write one complete and correct list of the external services used in this action file. Keep in mind that some answers may have incorrect terms which are not external services or databases (like libraries that are not external services, or services that do not exist) and you have to remove them. 
    Different answers may refer to the same service with different names, and there could be missing services that you have to add.
    Write this list of service names on a single line, with no introduction, further explanation or numeration, so like this:
    Service1, Service2, Service3 
    In a new section titled "Purpose of external services" explain the purpose of each service.
    If the file doesn't use any external service nor database, answer only with "NO" and nothing else

RESPONSE
Raspberry Pi Camera, face_recognition, source/encodings.npy

Purpose of external services:
- Raspberry Pi Camera: Used to capture images for face recognition.
- face_recognition: A library used to detect and recognize faces in images.
- source/encodings.npy: A local file containing precomputed face encodings for known individuals.
