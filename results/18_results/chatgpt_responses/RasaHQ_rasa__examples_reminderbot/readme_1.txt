Problem: This is a README file from a Rasa chatbot repository # Reminderbot

The `reminderbot` example demonstrates how your bot can respond to external events or reminders.

## Whatâ€™s inside this example?

This example contains some training data and the main files needed to build an
assistant on your local machine. The `reminderbot` consists of the following files:

- **data/nlu.yml** contains training examples for the NLU model
- **data/rules.yml** contains rules for the Core model
- **config.yml** contains the model configuration
- **domain.yml** contains the domain of the assistant
- **credentials.yml** contains credentials for the different channels
- **endpoints.yml** contains the different endpoints reminderbot can use
- **actions/actions.py** contains the custom actions that deal with external events and reminders

## How to use this example?

To train and chat with `reminderbot`, execute the following steps:

1. Train a Rasa Open Source model containing the Rasa NLU and Rasa Core models by running:
    ```
    rasa train
    ```
    The model will be stored in the `/models` directory as a zipped file.

2. Run a Rasa SDK action server with
    ```
    rasa run actions
    ```

3. To test this example, run a
   [callback channel](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/connectors/your-own-website#callbackinput).
   In a separate console window from where you ran the step 2 command:
    ```
    python callback_server.py
    ```

   This will run a server that prints the bot's responses to the console.

   Start your Rasa server in a third console window:
   ```
   rasa run --enable-api
   ```

   You can then send messages to the bot via the callback channel endpoint:
   ```
   curl -XPOST http://localhost:5005/webhooks/callback/webhook \
      -d '{"sender": "tester", "message": "hello"}' \
      -H "Content-type: application/json"
   ```

For more information about the individual commands, please check out our
[documentation](http://rasa.com/docs/rasa/command-line-interface).

        Does the chatbot use any database (local or external) or any external service? Answer with a list of these databases and services (only names on a single line, no further explanation, no numeration). 
        
    For this problem I received these answers, each with a list of services:
    None
None
None
None
None
None
None
None
None
None
    Basing on these answers and on the action file written in the problem, write one complete and correct list of the external services used in this action file. Keep in mind that some answers may have incorrect terms which are not external services or databases (like libraries that are not external services, or services that do not exist) and you have to remove them. 
    Different answers may refer to the same service with different names, and there could be missing services that you have to add.
    Write this list of service names on a single line, with no introduction, further explanation or numeration, so like this:
    Service1, Service2, Service3 
    In a new section titled "Purpose of external services" explain the purpose of each service.
    If the file doesn't use any external service nor database, answer only with "NO" and nothing else

RESPONSE
NO
