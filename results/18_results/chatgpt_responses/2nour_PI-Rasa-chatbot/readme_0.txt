REQUEST
Problem: This is a README file from a Rasa chatbot repository # PI-Rasa-chatbot
A Banking chatbot solution built with RASA using four languages: Arabic, English, French and Tunisian dialect 
This solution aims to provide users with response to commonly asked questions about bank services as well as taking actions such as:
  - User sign-up
  - User sign-in (Flask interface)
  - Currency convertor 
  - Money Transfer
  - Email notifications
  - Id card verification through camera using AI

The chat bot was deployed on Messanger and on a Flask web site 
  
 

        Does the chatbot use any database (local or external) or any external service? Answer with a list of these databases and services (only names on a single line, no further explanation, no numeration). 
        
    For this problem I received these answers, each with a list of services:
    Databases and services: Flask, AI, Messanger
Databases and services: Flask, AI, Messanger
Databases and services: Flask, AI, Messanger
Databases and services: Flask, Messanger, AI
Databases and services: Flask, Messanger, AI
Databases and services: Flask, Messanger, AI for id card verification
Databases and services: Flask, Messanger, AI
Databases and services: Flask, Messanger, AI for id card verification
Databases and services: Flask, Messanger, AI for ID card verification
Databases and services: Flask, AI, Messanger
    Basing on these answers and on the action file written in the problem, write one complete and correct list of the external services used in this action file. Keep in mind that some answers may have incorrect terms which are not external services or databases (like libraries that are not external services, or services that do not exist) and you have to remove them. 
    Different answers may refer to the same service with different names, and there could be missing services that you have to add.
    Write this list of service names on a single line, with no introduction, further explanation or numeration, so like this:
    Service1, Service2, Service3 
    In a new section titled "Purpose of external services" explain the purpose of each service.
    If the file doesn't use any external service nor database, answer only with "NO" and nothing else

RESPONSE
Flask, Messenger, AI

Purpose of external services:
- Flask: Used for user sign-in interface and web deployment.
