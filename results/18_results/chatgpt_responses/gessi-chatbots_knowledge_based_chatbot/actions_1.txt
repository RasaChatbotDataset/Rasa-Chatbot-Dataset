Problem: This is a python actions.py file of Rasa chatbot import random
from typing import Any, Text, Dict, List
from xmlrpc.client import boolean

from rasa_sdk import Action, Tracker
from rasa_sdk.executor import CollectingDispatcher
from rasa_sdk.events import UserUtteranceReverted

import json 

class KnowledgeBase():
    def __init__(self):
        with open('rasa_knowledge_base.json', 'r') as f:
            self.data = json.load(f)

        self.features = {}
        self.filterFeatures = {}
        for header in self.data['apps'][0].keys():
            self.features[header] = set()
            self.filterFeatures[header] = set()
    
    def getFilterFeatures(self) -> Dict:
        return self.filterFeatures
    
    def setFilterFeatures(self, ff) -> None:
        self.filterFeatures = ff
    
    def updateFilterFeatures(self, header, value) -> None:
        self.filterFeatures[header].update(value)

    def getFeatures(self) -> Dict:
        return self.features
    
    def getData(self) -> Dict:
        return self.data['apps'] 
        Does the chatbot use any database (local or external) or any external service? Answer with a list of these databases and services (only names on a single line, no further explanation, no numeration). 
        
    For this problem I received these answers, each with a list of services:
    rasa_knowledge_base.json
rasa_knowledge_base.json
rasa_knowledge_base.json
rasa_knowledge_base.json
rasa_knowledge_base.json
rasa_knowledge_base.json
rasa_knowledge_base.json
rasa_knowledge_base.json
rasa_knowledge_base.json
rasa_knowledge_base.json
    Basing on these answers and on the action file written in the problem, write one complete and correct list of the external services used in this action file. Keep in mind that some answers may have incorrect terms which are not external services or databases (like libraries that are not external services, or services that do not exist) and you have to remove them. 
    Different answers may refer to the same service with different names, and there could be missing services that you have to add.
    Write this list of service names on a single line, with no introduction, further explanation or numeration, so like this:
    Service1, Service2, Service3 
    In a new section titled "Purpose of external services" explain the purpose of each service.
    If the file doesn't use any external service nor database, answer only with "NO" and nothing else

RESPONSE
rasa_knowledge_base.json

Purpose of external services:
rasa_knowledge_base.json: This is a local JSON file used as a knowledge base to store and retrieve information about various applications. The chatbot uses this file to access and filter data based on user queries.
