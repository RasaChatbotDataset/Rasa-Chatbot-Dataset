REQUEST
Problem: This is a python actions.py file of Rasa chatbot # This files contains your custom actions which can be used to run
# custom Python code.
#
# See this guide on how to implement these action:
# https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/custom-actions


# This is a simple example for a custom action which utters "Hello World!"

# from typing import Any, Text, Dict, List
#
# from rasa_sdk import Action, Tracker
# from rasa_sdk.executor import CollectingDispatcher
#
#
# class ActionHelloWorld(Action):
#
#     def name(self) -> Text:
#         return "action_hello_world"
#
#     def run(self, dispatcher: CollectingDispatcher,
#             tracker: Tracker,
#             domain: Dict[Text, Any]) -> List[Dict[Text, Any]]:
#
#         dispatcher.utter_message(text="Hello World!")
#
#         return []

import requests
import json
from rasa_sdk import Action


class ActionJoke(Action):
  def name(self):
    return "action_joke"

  def run(self, dispatcher, tracker, domain):
    request = requests.get('http://api.icndb.com/jokes/random').json()  # make an api call
    joke = request['value']['joke']  # extract a joke from returned json response
    dispatcher.utter_message(text=joke)  # send the message back to the user
    return [] 
        Does the chatbot use any database (local or external) or any external service? Answer with a list of these databases and services (only names on a single line, no further explanation, no numeration). 
        
    For this problem I received these answers, each with a list of services:
    icndb
icndb.com
api.icndb.com
ICNDb
ICNDb
api.icndb.com
requests, api.icndb.com
ICNDb
ICNDb
requests, api.icndb.com
    Basing on these answers and on the action file written in the problem, write one complete and correct list of the external services used in this action file. Keep in mind that some answers may have incorrect terms which are not external services or databases (like libraries that are not external services, or services that do not exist) and you have to remove them. 
    Different answers may refer to the same service with different names, and there could be missing services that you have to add.
    Write this list of service names on a single line, with no introduction, further explanation or numeration, so like this:
    Service1, Service2, Service3 
    In a new section titled "Purpose of external services" explain the purpose of each service.
    If the file doesn't use any external service nor database, answer only with "NO" and nothing else

RESPONSE
api.icndb.com

Purpose of external services:
api.icndb.com: This service is used to fetch random jokes from the Internet Chuck Norris Database (ICNDb).
