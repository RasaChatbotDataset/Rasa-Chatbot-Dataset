Problem: This is a python actions.py file of Rasa chatbot # This files contains your custom actions which can be used to run
# custom Python code.
#
# See this guide on how to implement these action:
# https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/core/actions/#custom-actions/


# This is a simple example for a custom action which utters "Hello World!"

        dispatcher.utter_message(text=output)

        return []
 
        Does the chatbot use any database (local or external) or any external service? Answer with a list of these databases and services (only names on a single line, no further explanation, no numeration). 
        
    For this problem I received these answers, each with a list of services:
    list_of_symptoms.pickle, fitted_model.pickle
list_of_symptoms.pickle, fitted_model.pickle
list_of_symptoms.pickle, fitted_model.pickle
list_of_symptoms.pickle, fitted_model.pickle
list_of_symptoms.pickle, fitted_model.pickle
list_of_symptoms.pickle, fitted_model.pickle
list_of_symptoms.pickle, fitted_model.pickle
list_of_symptoms.pickle, fitted_model.pickle
list_of_symptoms.pickle, fitted_model.pickle
Databases and Services: ,- list_of_symptoms.pickle,- fitted_model.pickle
    Basing on these answers and on the action file written in the problem, write one complete and correct list of the external services used in this action file. Keep in mind that some answers may have incorrect terms which are not external services or databases (like libraries that are not external services, or services that do not exist) and you have to remove them. 
    Different answers may refer to the same service with different names, and there could be missing services that you have to add.
    Write this list of service names on a single line, with no introduction, further explanation or numeration, so like this:
    Service1, Service2, Service3 
    In a new section titled "Purpose of external services" explain the purpose of each service.
    If the file doesn't use any external service nor database, answer only with "NO" and nothing else

RESPONSE
list_of_symptoms.pickle, fitted_model.pickle

Purpose of external services:
- list_of_symptoms.pickle: This file is used to load a pre-defined list of symptoms that the chatbot can recognize and process. It serves as a reference for identifying which symptoms are present in the user's input.
- fitted_model.pickle: This file contains a pre-trained machine learning model that is used to predict the disease based on the symptoms provided by the user. The model analyzes the input symptoms and outputs a potential diagnosis.
