REQUEST
Problem: This is a python actions.py file of Rasa chatbot from .ambulance_service_db import Ambulance_Service
from faker import Faker
fake = Faker('en-IN')

user=Ambulance_Service()
user.create_table()
def fake_details_generating():
    user.insert_details('Arjun','+919074774118','Chengannur,Kerala')

    location=['Mannar,Kerala','Kollam,Kerala','Kottayam,Kerala','Kochi,Kerala','Chengannur,Kerala','Palakkad,Kerala','Kannur,Kerala','Chennai,Tamil nadu','Adoor,Kerala','Thrissur,Kerala','Alappuzha,Kerala','Munnar,Kerala','Vagamon,Kerala','Thiruvananthapuram,Kerala','Ernakulam,Kerala','Pathanamthitta,Kerala','Changanassery,Kerala','Kallissery,kerala']
    for _ in range(len(location)):
        user.insert_details(fake.first_name_male(),fake.phone_number(),location[_])

print(user.fetch())
    # print(user.fetch()[-1][0])
if user.fetch()==[] or len(user.fetch())<10:
    print("fake details created")
    fake_details_generating()


def add_ambulance_driver_details(name,mobile,place):
    name_from_db=[i[1] for i in user.fetch()]
    print(name_from_db)
    if name.title() not in name_from_db:
        user.insert_details(name.title(), mobile, place.title())
        return f"{name} your user id created with id number {user.fetch()[-1][0]} save this id for further usage"
    else:
        return "User already exists with same name"

def update_ambulance_driver_details(name,mobile,place,id):
    user.update_details(name.title(),mobile,place.title(),id)
    return f"user successfully updated"
 
        Does the chatbot use any database (local or external) or any external service? Answer with a list of these databases and services (only names on a single line, no further explanation, no numeration). 
        
    For this problem I received these answers, each with a list of services:
    Ambulance_Service, Faker
Ambulance_Service, Faker
Databases and services: Ambulance_Service, Faker
Ambulance_Service, Faker
Ambulance_Service, Faker
Ambulance_Service, Faker,,###
Ambulance_Service, Faker
Ambulance_Service, Faker
Ambulance_Service, Faker
Ambulance_Service, Faker
    Basing on these answers and on the action file written in the problem, write one complete and correct list of the external services used in this action file. Keep in mind that some answers may have incorrect terms which are not external services or databases (like libraries that are not external services, or services that do not exist) and you have to remove them. 
    Different answers may refer to the same service with different names, and there could be missing services that you have to add.
    Write this list of service names on a single line, with no introduction, further explanation or numeration, so like this:
    Service1, Service2, Service3 
    In a new section titled "Purpose of external services" explain the purpose of each service.
    If the file doesn't use any external service nor database, answer only with "NO" and nothing else

RESPONSE
Ambulance_Service, Faker

Purpose of external services:
Ambulance_Service: This service is used to manage ambulance driver details, including creating, updating, and fetching records from a database.
Faker: This service is used to generate fake data, such as names and phone numbers, for testing purposes.
