Problem: This is a python actions.py file of Rasa chatbot import json
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

"""

An utility or helper abstract class with some default methods
to print nested dictionaries in Models/Objects. Sometimes the nested data models are not printed and can not be produce
json.

class CustomUtilityDict(dict, ABC):
    """
    Custom DICT helper class: printable and serializable object

    CustomUtilityDict is a subclass of the built-in dict class that adds several additional features:
    It is printable and serializable using the json module.

    It has an update_props() method, which is called automatically by the class whenever one of the dictionary methods
     is called. This method is marked as abstract, so it must be implemented by any subclass of CustomUtilityDict.
    Example
    Here is an example of how to use CustomUtilityDict:

    ```class MyCustomDict(CustomUtilityDict):
        def __init__(self):
            super().__init__()
            self.name: str = ""

        def update_props(self):
            self.key_value["name"] = self.name

        my_dict = MyCustomDict()
        my_dict["key1"] = "value1"
        my_dict["key2"] = "value2"
    ```

        super().__init__()
        self.key_value = dict(*args, **kw)

        self.update_props()
        return self.key_value[key]

    def __setitem__(self, key, value):
        self.key_value[key] = value

    def __iter__(self):
        self.update_props()
        return iter(self.key_value)

    def __len__(self):
        self.update_props()
        return len(self.key_value)

    def __delitem__(self, key):
        self.update_props()
        del self.key_value[key]

    def __str__(self):
        self.update_props()
        # return json.dumps(self, default=lambda o: o.__dict__,)

        Assign all the variables/properties in "self" object as key value pair.
        So when you will print it, it will print the dictionary with values up to date.

        I.e. if your model has some variables/properties:

        ```
        self.name: str = ""
        self.event_type: str = ""
        self.attributes: dict[str, dict] = {}
        ```

        These properties should be added in the update_props method as follows in order to print all values
        ```
        self.key_value["name"] = self.name
        self.key_value["event_type"] = self.event_type
        self.key_value["attributes"] = self.attributes

        Does the chatbot use any database (local or external) or any external service? Answer with a list of these databases and services (only names on a single line, no further explanation, no numeration). 
        
    For this problem I received these answers, each with a list of services:
    None
None
None
Databases: MySQL, MongoDB,External Services: OpenWeatherMap, Twilio,,###
None
None
None
None
None
Databases and services: MySQL, MongoDB, Redis, Elasticsearch, Twilio, Slack, Facebook Messenger, Google Maps API
    Basing on these answers and on the action file written in the problem, write one complete and correct list of the external services used in this action file. Keep in mind that some answers may have incorrect terms which are not external services or databases (like libraries that are not external services, or services that do not exist) and you have to remove them. 
    Different answers may refer to the same service with different names, and there could be missing services that you have to add.
    Write this list of service names on a single line, with no introduction, further explanation or numeration, so like this:
    Service1, Service2, Service3 
    In a new section titled "Purpose of external services" explain the purpose of each service.
    If the file doesn't use any external service nor database, answer only with "NO" and nothing else

RESPONSE
NO
