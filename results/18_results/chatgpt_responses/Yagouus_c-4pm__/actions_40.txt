REQUEST
Problem: This is a python actions.py file of Rasa chatbot import os
import sys

sys.path.insert(1, os.path.join(sys.path[0], '../..'))

from nl2ltl.engines.gpt.core import GPTEngine
from nl2ltl import translate
from nl2ltl.engines.utils import _top_result
from nl2ltl.filters.simple_filters import BasicFilter


def run(utterance):
    engine = GPTEngine()
    filter = BasicFilter()

    ltlf_formulas = translate(utterance, engine, filter)
    return _top_result(ltlf_formulas) if ltlf_formulas else None
 
        Does the chatbot use any database (local or external) or any external service? Answer with a list of these databases and services (only names on a single line, no further explanation, no numeration). 
        
    For this problem I received these answers, each with a list of services:
    GPTEngine, translate, _top_result, BasicFilter
GPTEngine, translate, _top_result, BasicFilter
GPTEngine, translate, _top_result, BasicFilter
GPTEngine, translate, _top_result, BasicFilter
GPTEngine, translate, BasicFilter
GPTEngine, translate, _top_result, BasicFilter
GPTEngine, nl2ltl
GPTEngine, translate, BasicFilter
GPTEngine, translate, _top_result, BasicFilter
GPTEngine, translate, _top_result, BasicFilter
    Basing on these answers and on the action file written in the problem, write one complete and correct list of the external services used in this action file. Keep in mind that some answers may have incorrect terms which are not external services or databases (like libraries that are not external services, or services that do not exist) and you have to remove them. 
    Different answers may refer to the same service with different names, and there could be missing services that you have to add.
    Write this list of service names on a single line, with no introduction, further explanation or numeration, so like this:
    Service1, Service2, Service3 
    In a new section titled "Purpose of external services" explain the purpose of each service.
    If the file doesn't use any external service nor database, answer only with "NO" and nothing else

RESPONSE
GPTEngine, translate, _top_result, BasicFilter

Purpose of external services:
- GPTEngine: This service is used to process natural language input and generate corresponding LTLf (Linear Temporal Logic over finite traces) formulas.
- translate: This function is used to translate the natural language utterance into LTLf formulas using the specified engine and filter.
- _top_result: This utility function is used to extract the top result from the list of generated LTLf formulas.
- BasicFilter: This service is used to apply basic filtering to the generated LTLf formulas to ensure they meet certain criteria.
