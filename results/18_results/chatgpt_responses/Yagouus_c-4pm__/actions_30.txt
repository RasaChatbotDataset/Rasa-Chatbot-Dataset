Initializes class QueryChecking, inheriting from class PMTask


Attributes
-------
    consider_vacuity : bool
        True means that vacuously satisfied traces are considered as satisfied, violated otherwise.

    template_str : str, optional
        if specified, the query checking is restricted on this DECLARE template. If not, the query checking is
        performed over the whole set of supported templates.

    max_declare_cardinality : int, optional
        the maximum cardinality that the algorithm checks for DECLARE templates supporting it (default 1).

    activation : str, optional
        if specified, the query checking is restricted on this activation activity. If not, the query checking
        considers in turn each activity of the log as activation.

    target : str, optional
        if specified, the query checking is restricted on this target activity. If not, the query checking
        considers in turn each activity of the log as target.

    act_cond : str, optional
        activation condition to evaluate. It has to be written by following the DECLARE standard format.

    trg_cond : str, optional
        target condition to evaluate. It has to be written by following the DECLARE standard format.

    time_cond : str, optional
        time condition to evaluate. It has to be written by following the DECLARE standard format.

    min_support : float, optional
        the minimum support that a constraint needs to have to be included in the result (default 1).

        Does the chatbot use any database (local or external) or any external service? Answer with a list of these databases and services (only names on a single line, no further explanation, no numeration). 
        
    For this problem I received these answers, each with a list of services:
    Databases and services: D4PyEventLog, AbstractPMTask, ProcessModel
Databases and services: D4PyEventLog, AbstractPMTask, ProcessModel
None
None
None
Databases and services: D4PyEventLog, AbstractPMTask, ProcessModel
None
None
Databases and services: D4PyEventLog, AbstractPMTask, ProcessModel
Databases and services: D4PyEventLog, AbstractPMTask, ProcessModel
    Basing on these answers and on the action file written in the problem, write one complete and correct list of the external services used in this action file. Keep in mind that some answers may have incorrect terms which are not external services or databases (like libraries that are not external services, or services that do not exist) and you have to remove them. 
    Different answers may refer to the same service with different names, and there could be missing services that you have to add.
    Write this list of service names on a single line, with no introduction, further explanation or numeration, so like this:
    Service1, Service2, Service3 
    In a new section titled "Purpose of external services" explain the purpose of each service.
    If the file doesn't use any external service nor database, answer only with "NO" and nothing else

RESPONSE
D4PyEventLog, ProcessModel

Purpose of external services:
- D4PyEventLog: Used for handling and processing event logs in the context of process mining tasks.
- ProcessModel: Represents the process model used for query checking within the process mining framework.
