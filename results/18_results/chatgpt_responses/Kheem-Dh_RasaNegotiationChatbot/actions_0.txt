Problem: This is a python actions.py file of Rasa chatbot from typing import Any, Text, Dict, List
from rasa_sdk import Action, Tracker
from rasa_sdk.executor import CollectingDispatcher
from rasa_sdk.events import SlotSet

class ActionNegotiatePrice(Action):
    def name(self) -> Text:
        return "action_negotiate_price"

    def run(self, dispatcher: CollectingDispatcher,
            tracker: Tracker,
            domain: Dict[Text, Any]) -> List[Dict[Text, Any]]:

        product = tracker.get_slot('product')
        user_offer = next(tracker.get_latest_entity_values("offer_price"), None)

        # Example product data (you should replace this with your own data)
        product_data = {
            "Samsung Galaxy S10": {"retail_price": 300, "min_price": 270},
            "iPhone 8": {"retail_price": 400, "min_price": 360}
        }

        if product in product_data:
            retail_price = product_data[product]["retail_price"]
            min_price = product_data[product]["min_price"]
            counter_offer = self.calculate_counter_offer(user_offer, retail_price, min_price)

            dispatcher.utter_message(text=f"How about {counter_offer} for the {product}?")
            return [SlotSet("counter_offer_price", counter_offer)]
        else:
            dispatcher.utter_message(text="Sorry, I don't have information about this product.")
            return []

    @staticmethod
    def calculate_counter_offer(user_offer, retail_price, min_price):
        # Initial counter offer is the retail price
        if user_offer >= retail_price:
            return retail_price
        else:
            # Gradually decrease the price, but never below the minimum
            decrement_factor = 5  # or any other factor you choose
            new_offer = retail_price - decrement_factor

            # Ensure the offer does not go below the minimum price
            if new_offer < min_price:
                return min_price
            else:
                return new_offer

 
        Does the chatbot use any database (local or external) or any external service? Answer with a list of these databases and services (only names on a single line, no further explanation, no numeration). 
        
    For this problem I received these answers, each with a list of services:
    None
None
None
None
None
None
None
None
None
None
    Basing on these answers and on the action file written in the problem, write one complete and correct list of the external services used in this action file. Keep in mind that some answers may have incorrect terms which are not external services or databases (like libraries that are not external services, or services that do not exist) and you have to remove them. 
    Different answers may refer to the same service with different names, and there could be missing services that you have to add.
    Write this list of service names on a single line, with no introduction, further explanation or numeration, so like this:
    Service1, Service2, Service3 
    In a new section titled "Purpose of external services" explain the purpose of each service.
    If the file doesn't use any external service nor database, answer only with "NO" and nothing else

RESPONSE
NO
