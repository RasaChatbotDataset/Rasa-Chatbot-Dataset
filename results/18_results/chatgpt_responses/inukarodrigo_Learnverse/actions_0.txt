Problem: This is a python actions.py file of Rasa chatbot 
from typing import Any, Text, Dict, List

from rasa_sdk import Action, Tracker
from rasa_sdk.executor import CollectingDispatcher
from rasa_sdk.forms import FormAction, FormValidationAction


class ValidateHealthForm(FormValidationAction):
    def name(self) -> Text:
        return "validate_health_form"


class HealthForm(FormAction):

    def name(self):
        return "health_form"

    @staticmethod
    def required_slots(tracker): #returns the list of slots that needs to be filled before the submit method is invoked

        if tracker.get_slot('confirm_exercise') == True:
            return ["confirm_exercise", "exercise", "sleep", "diet", "stress", "goal"]
        else: #All slots exept excercise slot
            return ["confirm_exercise", "sleep","diet", "stress", "goal"]

    def submit( #Let's us execute whatever we want, once the required forms are filled
            self,
            dispatcher: CollectingDispatcher,
            tracker: Tracker,
            domain: Dict[Text, Any],
    ) -> List[Dict]:
        return []

    #optional - tell rasa how to fill the slots by extracting data from users responses
    def slot_mappings(self) -> Dict[Text, Union[Dict, List[Dict]]]:
        """A dictionary to map required slots to
            - an extracted entity
            - intent: value pairs
            - a whole message
            or a list of them, where a first match will be picked"""

        return {
            "confirm_exercise": [
                self.from_intent(intent="affirm", value=True),
                self.from_intent(intent="deny", value=False),
                self.from_intent(intent="inform", value=True),
            ],
            "sleep": [
                self.from_entity(entity="sleep"),
                self.from_intent(intent="deny", value="None"),
            ],
            "goal": [
                self.from_text(intent="inform"),
            ],
        }

 
        Does the chatbot use any database (local or external) or any external service? Answer with a list of these databases and services (only names on a single line, no further explanation, no numeration). 
        
    For this problem I received these answers, each with a list of services:
    None
None
None
None
None
None
None
None
None
None
    Basing on these answers and on the action file written in the problem, write one complete and correct list of the external services used in this action file. Keep in mind that some answers may have incorrect terms which are not external services or databases (like libraries that are not external services, or services that do not exist) and you have to remove them. 
    Different answers may refer to the same service with different names, and there could be missing services that you have to add.
    Write this list of service names on a single line, with no introduction, further explanation or numeration, so like this:
    Service1, Service2, Service3 
    In a new section titled "Purpose of external services" explain the purpose of each service.
    If the file doesn't use any external service nor database, answer only with "NO" and nothing else

RESPONSE
NO
