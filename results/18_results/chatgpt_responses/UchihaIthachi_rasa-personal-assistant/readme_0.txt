Problem: This is a README file from a Rasa chatbot repository # Hotel Assistant Chatbot

Welcome to the Hotel Assistant Chatbot project! This repository contains a conversational AI powered by the Rasa framework, integrating Language Model capabilities from OpenAI. The chatbot assists users with various hotel-related queries, leveraging both structured data and natural language understanding.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/hotel-assistant-bot.git
   cd hotel-assistant-bot
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**

   ```sh
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Training the Model

To train the Rasa model with your current data, run:

```sh
make train
```

This command will train the Rasa model using the domain, data, and configuration files, and save the trained model in the `models` directory.

### Running the Action Server

To start the action server, which handles custom actions, run:

```sh
make run-actions
```

### Interacting with the Bot

You can interact with the bot using Rasa Shell:

```sh
make shell
```

This will start the action server and open the Rasa shell, allowing you to chat with the bot in the terminal.

Alternatively, you can run the bot and interact with it via HTTP API:

```sh
make run
```

Once the server is running, you can interact with the bot using either of the following web applications:

- **[chatbot-html-js-css-web-app](./chatbot-html-js-css-web-app)**: Basic interface for chatting with the bot using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.
  - **Directory**: [Chatbot HTML + JS + CSS](https://github.com/JiteshGaikwad/Chatbot-Widget/tree/main)
- **[chatbot-react-vite-web-app](./chatbot-react-vite-web-app)**: Modern and dynamic web application using React + Vite.
  - **Directory**: [React Chat Widget](https://github.com/Wolox/react-chat-widget/tree/master)

To run the React application, navigate to its directory and execute `npm run dev`.

### Using Rasa X

To use Rasa X for managing and improving your bot, run:

```sh
make run-x
```

Open Rasa X in your web browser at `http://localhost:5002`. Rasa X provides an interface for chatting with your bot, reviewing conversations, annotating data, and retraining models.

## Configuration

- **Domain File:** `configs/domain.yml` contains the intents, entities, slots, responses, and forms used by the bot.
- **Training Data:** `data` directory contains the NLU and Core training data.
- **Config File:** `configs/config.yml` specifies the pipeline and policies for training the model.
- **Endpoints File:** `configs/endpoints.yml` defines the endpoints for the action server and other external services.

## Makefile Commands

Here are some useful commands to manage and run your Hotel Assistant Chatbot:

- **`make train`**: Train the Rasa model with domain, data, and config files.
- **`make train-nlu`**: Train only the NLU model.
- **`make run-actions`**: Start the action server for handling custom actions.
- **`make shell`**: Start the action server and open Rasa shell for interaction.
- **`make run`**: Start the action server and Rasa server with API enabled.
- **`make validate`**: Validate the Rasa configuration and training data.
- **`make help`**: Display help information with available targets.

        Does the chatbot use any database (local or external) or any external service? Answer with a list of these databases and services (only names on a single line, no further explanation, no numeration). 
        
    For this problem I received these answers, each with a list of services:
    None
None
None
None
None
None
None
None
None
None
    Basing on these answers and on the action file written in the problem, write one complete and correct list of the external services used in this action file. Keep in mind that some answers may have incorrect terms which are not external services or databases (like libraries that are not external services, or services that do not exist) and you have to remove them. 
    Different answers may refer to the same service with different names, and there could be missing services that you have to add.
    Write this list of service names on a single line, with no introduction, further explanation or numeration, so like this:
    Service1, Service2, Service3 
    In a new section titled "Purpose of external services" explain the purpose of each service.
    If the file doesn't use any external service nor database, answer only with "NO" and nothing else

RESPONSE
NO
