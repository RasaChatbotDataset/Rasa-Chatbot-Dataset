Problem: This is a python actions.py file of Rasa chatbot # This files contains your custom actions which can be used to run
# custom Python code.
#
# See this guide on how to implement these action:
# https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/custom-actions


# This is a simple example for a custom action which utters "ActionCheckWeather"

from typing import Any, Text, Dict, List
from rasa_sdk import Action, Tracker
from rasa_sdk.events import SlotSet
from rasa_sdk.executor import CollectingDispatcher
import requests


class ActionCheckWeather(Action):

    def name(self) -> Text:
        return "action_get_weather"

    def run(self, dispatcher, tracker, domain):

       api_key = 'Your API Key'
       loc = tracker.get_slot('location')
       current = requests.get('http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q={}&appid={}'.format(loc, api_key)).json()
       print(current)
       country = current['sys']['country']
       city = current['name']
       condition = current['weather'][0]['main'    ]
       temperature_c = current['main']['temp']
       humidity = current['main']['humidity']
       wind_mph = current['wind']['speed']
       response = """It is currently {} in {} at the moment. The temperature is {} degrees, the humidity is {}% and the wind speed is {} mph.""".format(condition, city, temperature_c, humidity, wind_mph)
       dispatcher.utter_message(response)
       return [SlotSet('location', loc)]

        
 
        Does the chatbot use any database (local or external) or any external service? Answer with a list of these databases and services (only names on a single line, no further explanation, no numeration). 
        
    For this problem I received these answers, each with a list of services:
    External services: OpenWeatherMap
External services: OpenWeatherMap
OpenWeatherMap
External services: OpenWeatherMap
OpenWeatherMap
External services: OpenWeatherMap
External services: OpenWeatherMap
External services: OpenWeatherMap
OpenWeatherMap
External services: OpenWeatherMap
    Basing on these answers and on the action file written in the problem, write one complete and correct list of the external services used in this action file. Keep in mind that some answers may have incorrect terms which are not external services or databases (like libraries that are not external services, or services that do not exist) and you have to remove them. 
    Different answers may refer to the same service with different names, and there could be missing services that you have to add.
    Write this list of service names on a single line, with no introduction, further explanation or numeration, so like this:
    Service1, Service2, Service3 
    In a new section titled "Purpose of external services" explain the purpose of each service.
    If the file doesn't use any external service nor database, answer only with "NO" and nothing else

RESPONSE
OpenWeatherMap

Purpose of external services:
OpenWeatherMap: This service is used to fetch current weather data for a specified location, including details such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions.
