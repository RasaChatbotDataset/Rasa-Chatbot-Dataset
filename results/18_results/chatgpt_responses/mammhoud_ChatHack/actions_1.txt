Problem: This is a python actions.py file of Rasa chatbot from slack import WebClient


class SlackApp:
    def __init__(self, channel_name=None, channel_id=None):
        self.token = open("secret_slack_token.txt", "r").readlines()[0]
        self.client = WebClient(token=self.token)

        self.users = self.client.users_list()

        self.channel = None
        self.channel_name = channel_name
        self.channel_id = channel_id

        if channel_name:
            self.getChannelId(channel_name)

    def getChannelId(self, channel_name=None):
        """Get the Channel's ID from its name"""
        name = channel_name if channel_name else self.channel_name

        try:
            for channel in self.client.conversations_list()["channels"]:
                if channel["name"] == name:
                    self.channel = channel
                    self.channel_name = channel["name"]
                    self.channel_id = channel["id"]
                    return channel["id"]
            return None

        except Exception as e:
            print(f"SlackApp getChannelId Error: {e}")
            return None

    def sendMessage(self, message="", channel_name=None):
        """Check https://api.slack.com/reference/surfaces/formatting for message formatting"""
        channel_id = (
            self.getChannelId(channel_name)
            if (channel_name or not self.channel_id)
            else self.channel_id
        )

        try:
            result = self.client.chat_postMessage(channel=channel_id, text=message)
            return result

        except Exception as e:
            print(f"SlackApp sendMessage Error: {e}")
            return None

 
        Does the chatbot use any database (local or external) or any external service? Answer with a list of these databases and services (only names on a single line, no further explanation, no numeration). 
        
    For this problem I received these answers, each with a list of services:
    Slack
Slack
Slack
Slack
Slack
Slack
Slack
Slack
Slack
Slack
    Basing on these answers and on the action file written in the problem, write one complete and correct list of the external services used in this action file. Keep in mind that some answers may have incorrect terms which are not external services or databases (like libraries that are not external services, or services that do not exist) and you have to remove them. 
    Different answers may refer to the same service with different names, and there could be missing services that you have to add.
    Write this list of service names on a single line, with no introduction, further explanation or numeration, so like this:
    Service1, Service2, Service3 
    In a new section titled "Purpose of external services" explain the purpose of each service.
    If the file doesn't use any external service nor database, answer only with "NO" and nothing else

RESPONSE
Slack

Purpose of external services:
Slack: The Slack service is used for sending messages to Slack channels and retrieving user and channel information.
