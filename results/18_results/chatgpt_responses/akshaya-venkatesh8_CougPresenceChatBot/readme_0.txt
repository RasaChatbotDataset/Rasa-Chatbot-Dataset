REQUEST
Problem: This is a README file from a Rasa chatbot repository #Chat Bot - Coug Presence

This is a chat bot that can answer questions about WSU Pullman events and activities. The bot's output channel is Facebook Messenger. The bot is powered by RASA. 

        Does the chatbot use any database (local or external) or any external service? Answer with a list of these databases and services (only names on a single line, no further explanation, no numeration). 
        
    For this problem I received these answers, each with a list of services:
    None
None
Databases and services: Facebook Messenger, RASA
None
None
Facebook Messenger, RASA
Databases and services: Facebook Messenger, RASA
Databases and services: Facebook Messenger, RASA
Facebook Messenger, RASA
Databases and services: Facebook Messenger, RASA
    Basing on these answers and on the action file written in the problem, write one complete and correct list of the external services used in this action file. Keep in mind that some answers may have incorrect terms which are not external services or databases (like libraries that are not external services, or services that do not exist) and you have to remove them. 
    Different answers may refer to the same service with different names, and there could be missing services that you have to add.
    Write this list of service names on a single line, with no introduction, further explanation or numeration, so like this:
    Service1, Service2, Service3 
    In a new section titled "Purpose of external services" explain the purpose of each service.
    If the file doesn't use any external service nor database, answer only with "NO" and nothing else

RESPONSE
Facebook Messenger, RASA

Purpose of external services:
- Facebook Messenger: This service is used as the output channel for the chatbot, allowing it to communicate with users through Facebook's messaging platform.
- RASA: This is the framework powering the chatbot, providing natural language understanding and dialogue management capabilities.
