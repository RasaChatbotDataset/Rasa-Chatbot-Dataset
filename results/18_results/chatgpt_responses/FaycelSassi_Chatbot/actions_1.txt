Problem: This is a python actions.py file of Rasa chatbot import pandas
doc = pandas.read_excel("../resources/LteFeatures1.xlsx")
print(doc.head())
doc.rename(columns={"Feature Name": "fullname","Feature Identity": "abbrv","Comments":"others"}, inplace=True)
doc['definition'] ="is in package name :"+ doc['Value Package Name'] + " ( "+doc['Value Package Identity']+" ) with License Control MO/DU radio Node,OptionalFeatureLicense= " +doc['License Control MO\nDU radio Node,\nOptionalFeatureLicense=\n']+ " and License Control MO/Baseband-based Node, FeatureState= "+doc['License Control MO\nBaseband-based Node,\nFeatureState=\n'] +" and featureState/Recommended Value =  "+doc['featureState\nRecommended Value']
# remove columns
doc = doc.drop(columns=['Value Package Name', 'Value Package Identity','License Control MO\nDU radio Node,\nOptionalFeatureLicense=\n','License Control MO\nBaseband-based Node,\nFeatureState=\n','featureState\nRecommended Value'])
doc = doc.reindex(["abbrv","fullname","definition","others"], axis=1)
# drop all rows with null values
doc = doc.dropna()
print(doc.isna().sum())
print( doc.shape[0])
import pymongo
client = pymongo.MongoClient("mongodb://localhost:27017/")
db = client["rasa"]
collection = db["chap1"]
data = doc.to_dict(orient='records')
collection.insert_many(data)

 
        Does the chatbot use any database (local or external) or any external service? Answer with a list of these databases and services (only names on a single line, no further explanation, no numeration). 
        
    For this problem I received these answers, each with a list of services:
    pandas, pymongo, MongoDB,,###
MongoDB
pandas, pymongo
pandas, pymongo
pandas, pymongo, MongoDB,,###
pandas, pymongo, MongoDB,,###
pandas, pymongo
pandas, pymongo, MongoDB,,###
pandas, pymongo, MongoDB,,###
pandas, pymongo
    Basing on these answers and on the action file written in the problem, write one complete and correct list of the external services used in this action file. Keep in mind that some answers may have incorrect terms which are not external services or databases (like libraries that are not external services, or services that do not exist) and you have to remove them. 
    Different answers may refer to the same service with different names, and there could be missing services that you have to add.
    Write this list of service names on a single line, with no introduction, further explanation or numeration, so like this:
    Service1, Service2, Service3 
    In a new section titled "Purpose of external services" explain the purpose of each service.
    If the file doesn't use any external service nor database, answer only with "NO" and nothing else

RESPONSE
pandas, pymongo, MongoDB

Purpose of external services:
- pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis, specifically for reading and processing the Excel file.
- pymongo: Used to interact with MongoDB, allowing the insertion of processed data into the database.
- MongoDB: A NoSQL database used to store the processed data from the Excel file.
