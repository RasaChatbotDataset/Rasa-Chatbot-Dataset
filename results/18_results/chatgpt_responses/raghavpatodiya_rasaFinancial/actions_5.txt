Problem: This is a python actions.py file of Rasa chatbot from typing import Any, Text, Dict, List
from rasa_sdk import Action, Tracker
from rasa_sdk.executor import CollectingDispatcher
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf
import json

class ActionBuySellHold(Action):
    def name(self) -> Text:
        return "get_buy_sell_hold"

    def run(self, dispatcher: CollectingDispatcher, tracker: Tracker, domain: Dict[Text, Any]) -> List[Dict[Text, Any]]:
        try:
            with open('stock_data.json', 'r') as file:
                data = json.load(file)

            predicted_price = data.get("predicted_price")
            current_price = data.get("current_price")
            currency = data.get("currency")

            if predicted_price is not None and current_price is not None:
                price_change = current_price - predicted_price
                price_change_percentage = (price_change / current_price) * 100
                if predicted_price > current_price:
                    dispatcher.utter_message(text=f"Recommendation: Buy. Predicted price: {predicted_price:.2f} {currency}, Current price: {current_price:.2f} {currency}")
                elif predicted_price < current_price and price_change_percentage > 10:
                    dispatcher.utter_message(text=f"Recommendation: Sell. Predicted price: {predicted_price:.2f} {currency}, Current price: {current_price:.2f} {currency}")
                else:
                    dispatcher.utter_message(text=f"Recommendation: Hold. Predicted price: {predicted_price:.2f} {currency}, Current price: {current_price:.2f} {currency}")
            else:
                dispatcher.utter_message(text="Unable to determine buy/sell/hold recommendation. Please try again later.")
        
        except Exception as e:

        return [] 
        Does the chatbot use any database (local or external) or any external service? Answer with a list of these databases and services (only names on a single line, no further explanation, no numeration). 
        
    For this problem I received these answers, each with a list of services:
    stock_data.json, yfinance
stock_data.json, yfinance
stock_data.json, yfinance
stock_data.json, yfinance
stock_data.json, yfinance
stock_data.json, yfinance
stock_data.json, yfinance
stock_data.json, yfinance
stock_data.json, yfinance
stock_data.json, yfinance
    Basing on these answers and on the action file written in the problem, write one complete and correct list of the external services used in this action file. Keep in mind that some answers may have incorrect terms which are not external services or databases (like libraries that are not external services, or services that do not exist) and you have to remove them. 
    Different answers may refer to the same service with different names, and there could be missing services that you have to add.
    Write this list of service names on a single line, with no introduction, further explanation or numeration, so like this:
    Service1, Service2, Service3 
    In a new section titled "Purpose of external services" explain the purpose of each service.
    If the file doesn't use any external service nor database, answer only with "NO" and nothing else

RESPONSE
stock_data.json

Purpose of external services:
- stock_data.json: This is a local JSON file used to store and retrieve stock data, including predicted and current prices, which the chatbot uses to make buy/sell/hold recommendations.
