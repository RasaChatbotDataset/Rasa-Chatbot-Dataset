Problem: This is a python actions.py file of Rasa chatbot import pandas as pd

def get_ticker(company_name):
    df = pd.read_csv('stock_data/nasdaq_screener.csv')
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        ticker = row['Symbol']
        name = row['Name'].lower()
        if company_name in name.split():
            print(ticker)
            return ticker
        if isinstance(ticker, str):
            try:
                lowered_symbol = ticker.lower()
            except AttributeError:
                lowered_symbol = ticker
                
            if lowered_symbol == company_name:
                print(ticker)
                return ticker
    
# what if company name is more that one word ? 
        Does the chatbot use any database (local or external) or any external service? Answer with a list of these databases and services (only names on a single line, no further explanation, no numeration). 
        
    For this problem I received these answers, each with a list of services:
    pandas, stock_data/nasdaq_screener.csv
stock_data/nasdaq_screener.csv
nasdaq_screener.csv
pandas, stock_data/nasdaq_screener.csv
stock_data/nasdaq_screener.csv
pandas
pandas
stock_data/nasdaq_screener.csv
pandas
pandas
    Basing on these answers and on the action file written in the problem, write one complete and correct list of the external services used in this action file. Keep in mind that some answers may have incorrect terms which are not external services or databases (like libraries that are not external services, or services that do not exist) and you have to remove them. 
    Different answers may refer to the same service with different names, and there could be missing services that you have to add.
    Write this list of service names on a single line, with no introduction, further explanation or numeration, so like this:
    Service1, Service2, Service3 
    In a new section titled "Purpose of external services" explain the purpose of each service.
    If the file doesn't use any external service nor database, answer only with "NO" and nothing else

RESPONSE
stock_data/nasdaq_screener.csv

Purpose of external services:
stock_data/nasdaq_screener.csv: This is a local CSV file that contains stock data, including company names and their corresponding ticker symbols. The chatbot uses this file to look up and return the ticker symbol for a given company name.
