REQUEST
Problem: This is a README file from a Rasa chatbot repository # Health Agent


pip install rasa
pip install "rasa[transformers]"
pip install scispacy
pip install pandas
pip install https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ai2-s2-scispacy/releases/v0.5.0/en_ner_bc5cdr_md-0.5.0.tar.gz

### Rasa server
To run the server, use the following command:

```commandline
rasa run --cors "*"
```


The --cors "*" command is used to solve the cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) problem between client and Rasa servers.


### Action server

```commandline
rasa run actions
```

Web client server
Run the following command:

```commandline
python -m http.server
```

This will start an HTTP-based server in the local 8000 port. We can visit http://localhost:8000 in a browser to visit the chatbot.



# Validations 
rasa data validate



        Does the chatbot use any database (local or external) or any external service? Answer with a list of these databases and services (only names on a single line, no further explanation, no numeration). 
        
    For this problem I received these answers, each with a list of services:
    None
None
None
None
None
None
None
None
None
None
    Basing on these answers and on the action file written in the problem, write one complete and correct list of the external services used in this action file. Keep in mind that some answers may have incorrect terms which are not external services or databases (like libraries that are not external services, or services that do not exist) and you have to remove them. 
    Different answers may refer to the same service with different names, and there could be missing services that you have to add.
    Write this list of service names on a single line, with no introduction, further explanation or numeration, so like this:
    Service1, Service2, Service3 
    In a new section titled "Purpose of external services" explain the purpose of each service.
    If the file doesn't use any external service nor database, answer only with "NO" and nothing else

RESPONSE
NO
