# Medoc - AI Medical Assistant

![chatbot_blog-1](https://github.com/Dennis-Maigua/ai-medical-assistant/assets/32156551/37f7de8b-e13c-42fd-a711-09d6122677cb)

This project implements a Conversational AI using RASA Open Source Framework. The Chatbot requests the user's symptoms, identifies the disease (diagnosis), recommends medication or doctor consultation, and provides information about any disease (if asked by a user) through the WikipediaApi.

# Design Features

1. Natural Language Understanding (NLU).

2. Dialogue Management.
  
3. Training Pipeline.

4. Integration and Deployment.

# Environment (Windows, Mac, Linux)

>**Note**: Make sure you have installed the latest version of [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-31011/) before proceeding. By default, `pip` comes pre-installed with Python. If missing, you can download it [here](https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py) and open to install it automatically.

Open a new terminal and run the following commands (one-by-one):

  ```bash
    $ git --version
    $ python --version
    $ pip --version
  ```

# Setup Installation

### Step 1. Clone the Repository

Clone and open the project in your local machine `desktop`:

  ```bash
    $ cd Desktop
    $ git clone https://github.com/Dennis-Maigua/ai-medical-assistant.git
    $ cd ai-medical-assistant
  ```

### Step 2. Create a Virtual Environment

Build and activate a `venv` folder inside the project:

  ```bash
   $ python -m venv venv
   $ venv/Scripts/activate
  ```
   
### Step 3. Install Packages and Dependencies

Install `rasa` and `python requirements` for running the project:
  
  ```bash
   $ pip install rasa
   $ rasa --version 
   $ pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

# Testing and Performance

>**Note**: Ignore all Deprecation Warnings in colors Red and Yellow! Errors or bugs that break the code functionality should be displayed in white, of which there are none currently. ðŸ˜Š

### Step 4. Train the Model

Always train the `NLU model` after making any code changes to `update` the chatbot:
  
  ```bash
   $ rasa train
  ```

### Step 5. Run the Chatbot

Open another `two` separate terminals and run the following commands:

- Terminal 1 (Actions):

  ```bash
    $ rasa run actions
  ```

- Terminal 2 (Rasa Server):

  ```bash
    # For frontend chatbot
    $ venv/Scripts/activate
    $ rasa run --model models --enable-api --cors "*"

    # For backend chatbot
    $ venv/Scripts/activate
    $ rasa shell
  ```

- Terminal 3 (Frontend Chatbot):

  ```bash
    $ venv/Scripts/activate
    $ python app.py
  ```

        Does the chatbot use any database (local or external) or any external service? Answer with a list of these databases and services (only names on a single line, no further explanation, no numeration). 
        
    For this problem I received these answers, each with a list of services:
    WikipediaApi,,#
WikipediaApi,,#
WikipediaApi,,#
WikipediaApi,,#
WikipediaApi,,#
WikipediaApi,,#
WikipediaApi,,#
WikipediaApi,,#
WikipediaApi,,#
WikipediaApi,,#
    Basing on these answers and on the action file written in the problem, write one complete and correct list of the external services used in this action file. Keep in mind that some answers may have incorrect terms which are not external services or databases (like libraries that are not external services, or services that do not exist) and you have to remove them. 
    Different answers may refer to the same service with different names, and there could be missing services that you have to add.
    Write this list of service names on a single line, with no introduction, further explanation or numeration, so like this:
    Service1, Service2, Service3 
    In a new section titled "Purpose of external services" explain the purpose of each service.
    If the file doesn't use any external service nor database, answer only with "NO" and nothing else

RESPONSE
WikipediaApi

# Purpose of external services

- **WikipediaApi**: This service is used to provide information about any disease when asked by the user.
