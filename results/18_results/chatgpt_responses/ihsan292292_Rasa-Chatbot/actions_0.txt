REQUEST
Problem: This is a python actions.py file of Rasa chatbot # This files contains your custom actions which can be used to run
# custom Python code.
#
# See this guide on how to implement these action:
# https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/custom-actions


# This is a simple example for a custom action which utters "Hello World!"

from typing import Any, Text, Dict, List
from diaganose_functions.diagnose import encode_symptom, create_illness_vector, get_diagnosis
from rasa_sdk import Action, Tracker
from rasa_sdk.executor import CollectingDispatcher




class ActionDiagnoseSymptoms(Action):

    def name(self) -> Text:
        return "action_diagnose_symptoms"

    def run(self, dispatcher: CollectingDispatcher,
            tracker: Tracker,
            domain: Dict[Text, Any]) -> List[Dict[Text, Any]]:
        
        symptoms = tracker.get_slot("symptom")
        
        # encode each symptom
        encoded_symptoms = [encode_symptom(symptom) for symptom in symptoms]
        
        # create a binary vector of symptoms to compare to each each documented illness
        illness_vector = create_illness_vector(encoded_symptoms)

        diagnosis_string = get_diagnosis(illness_vector)

        dispatcher.utter_message(text=diagnosis_string) 
        Does the chatbot use any database (local or external) or any external service? Answer with a list of these databases and services (only names on a single line, no further explanation, no numeration). 
        
    For this problem I received these answers, each with a list of services:
    None
diaganose_functions.diagnose
None
None
encode_symptom, create_illness_vector, get_diagnosis
None
diaganose_functions.diagnose
diaganose_functions.diagnose
None
diaganose_functions.diagnose
    Basing on these answers and on the action file written in the problem, write one complete and correct list of the external services used in this action file. Keep in mind that some answers may have incorrect terms which are not external services or databases (like libraries that are not external services, or services that do not exist) and you have to remove them. 
    Different answers may refer to the same service with different names, and there could be missing services that you have to add.
    Write this list of service names on a single line, with no introduction, further explanation or numeration, so like this:
    Service1, Service2, Service3 
    In a new section titled "Purpose of external services" explain the purpose of each service.
    If the file doesn't use any external service nor database, answer only with "NO" and nothing else

RESPONSE
diaganose_functions.diagnose

Purpose of external services:
- diaganose_functions.diagnose: This module is used to encode symptoms, create a binary vector of symptoms, and get a diagnosis based on the encoded symptoms.
