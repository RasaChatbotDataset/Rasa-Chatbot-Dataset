REQUEST
Problem: This is a README file from a Rasa chatbot repository # Flask API for Flow Blockchain

## Prerequisites

Before running the API, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

1. **Python**: Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.

## Running the API

Follow these steps to run the Flask API:

Navigate to the Directory: Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where your api.py file is located.

Activate a Virtual Environment (Optional): It's a good practice to create and activate a virtual environment for your project to isolate dependencies. You can create a virtual environment using virtualenv or venv.

Run the Flask Application: To start the Flask API, use the following command:

```bash
python api.py
```

The Flask development server will start, and you'll see output indicating that the server is running. By default, the API will be accessible at http://127.0.0.1:5000/.

Accessing the API: You can access the API by making HTTP requests to the specified endpoints.

GET **/account_info<account_address>**: Retrieve account information for the specified account address.

POST **/execute_transaction**: Execute a transaction by providing account information, signer key, and amount in the request body.

        Does the chatbot use any database (local or external) or any external service? Answer with a list of these databases and services (only names on a single line, no further explanation, no numeration). 
        
    For this problem I received these answers, each with a list of services:
    None
None
None
None
Flow Blockchain,,##
None
None
None
Flow Blockchain,,##
None
    Basing on these answers and on the action file written in the problem, write one complete and correct list of the external services used in this action file. Keep in mind that some answers may have incorrect terms which are not external services or databases (like libraries that are not external services, or services that do not exist) and you have to remove them. 
    Different answers may refer to the same service with different names, and there could be missing services that you have to add.
    Write this list of service names on a single line, with no introduction, further explanation or numeration, so like this:
    Service1, Service2, Service3 
    In a new section titled "Purpose of external services" explain the purpose of each service.
    If the file doesn't use any external service nor database, answer only with "NO" and nothing else

RESPONSE
Flow Blockchain

## Purpose of external services

**Flow Blockchain**: This service is used to interact with the Flow blockchain network, allowing the API to retrieve account information and execute transactions on the blockchain.
