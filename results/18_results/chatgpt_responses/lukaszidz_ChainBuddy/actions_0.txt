Problem: This is a python actions.py file of Rasa chatbot from rasa_sdk import Action
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import requests
import os


class ActionGetAccountInfo(Action):
    def __init__(self) -> None:
        load_dotenv()
        self.buddy_api_url = os.environ.get('BUDDY_API_URL')

    def name(self):
        return "action_get_account_info"

    def run(self, dispatcher, tracker, domain):        
        account_address = tracker.get_slot("account_address")
        response = requests.get(f"{self.buddy_api_url}/account_info/{account_address}")
        dispatcher.utter_message(text=f"Account info: {response.json()}")

class ActionBuyBuddyToken(Action):
    def __init__(self) -> None:
        load_dotenv()
        self.buddy_api_url = os.environ.get('BUDDY_API_URL')
            
    def name(self):
        return "action_buy_buddy_token"

    def run(self, dispatcher, tracker, domain):
        account_address = tracker.get_slot("account_address")
        signer_key = tracker.get_slot("signer_key")

        if not account_address or not signer_key:
            dispatcher.utter_message(text=f'Missing information for transaction. Account address: {account_address}. Signer key: {signer_key}')
            return
        
        amount = 1  # This could also be extracted from user message if needed
        
        payload = {
            "account_address": account_address,
            "signer_key": signer_key,
            "amount": amount
        }
        
        response = requests.post(f"{self.buddy_api_url}/execute_transaction", json=payload)
        # Assume the API returns a message on success
        dispatcher.utter_message(text=f"Transaction result: {response.json().get('message')}")
 
        Does the chatbot use any database (local or external) or any external service? Answer with a list of these databases and services (only names on a single line, no further explanation, no numeration). 
        
    For this problem I received these answers, each with a list of services:
    Buddy API
Buddy API
Buddy API
Buddy API
Buddy API
Buddy API
Buddy API
Buddy API
Buddy API
Buddy API
    Basing on these answers and on the action file written in the problem, write one complete and correct list of the external services used in this action file. Keep in mind that some answers may have incorrect terms which are not external services or databases (like libraries that are not external services, or services that do not exist) and you have to remove them. 
    Different answers may refer to the same service with different names, and there could be missing services that you have to add.
    Write this list of service names on a single line, with no introduction, further explanation or numeration, so like this:
    Service1, Service2, Service3 
    In a new section titled "Purpose of external services" explain the purpose of each service.
    If the file doesn't use any external service nor database, answer only with "NO" and nothing else

RESPONSE
Buddy API

Purpose of external services:
Buddy API: The Buddy API is used to fetch account information and execute transactions for the chatbot.
