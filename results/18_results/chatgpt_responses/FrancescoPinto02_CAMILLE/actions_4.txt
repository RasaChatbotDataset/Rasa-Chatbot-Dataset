REQUEST
Problem: This is a python actions.py file of Rasa chatbot from typing import Any, Text, Dict, List, Optional
from rasa_sdk import Action, Tracker
from rasa_sdk.executor import CollectingDispatcher
from db.query import get_all_code_smells
import logging


class ActionGetCodeSmellsList(Action):

    def name(self) -> Text:
        return "action_get_code_smells_list"

    def run(self, dispatcher: CollectingDispatcher,
            tracker: Tracker,
            domain: Dict[Text, Any]) -> List[Dict[Text, Any]]:

        try:
            # Retrieve all the code smells
            results = get_all_code_smells(["id", "name"])
        except Exception as e:
            logging.error(f"Failed to fetch code smells: {e}")
            dispatcher.utter_message(text="Sorry, something went wrong while fetching the code smells...")
            return []

        if results:
            # Build the response
            message_lines = ["Here is the list of code smells:"]
            for code_smell in results:
                message_lines.append(f"{code_smell['id']}: {code_smell['name']}")
            message_lines.append("\nYou can ask me for more information or examples about each code smell in the list.")
            message = "\n".join(message_lines)
            dispatcher.utter_message(text=message)
        else:
            dispatcher.utter_message(text="No code smells found...")

        return []
 
        Does the chatbot use any database (local or external) or any external service? Answer with a list of these databases and services (only names on a single line, no further explanation, no numeration). 
        
    For this problem I received these answers, each with a list of services:
    Databases: get_all_code_smells
Database: get_all_code_smells
Databases: get_all_code_smells
Database: db.query
Database: get_all_code_smells
Database: get_all_code_smells
Databases: get_all_code_smells
Databases: get_all_code_smells
Databases and services: get_all_code_smells
Database: db.query
    Basing on these answers and on the action file written in the problem, write one complete and correct list of the external services used in this action file. Keep in mind that some answers may have incorrect terms which are not external services or databases (like libraries that are not external services, or services that do not exist) and you have to remove them. 
    Different answers may refer to the same service with different names, and there could be missing services that you have to add.
    Write this list of service names on a single line, with no introduction, further explanation or numeration, so like this:
    Service1, Service2, Service3 
    In a new section titled "Purpose of external services" explain the purpose of each service.
    If the file doesn't use any external service nor database, answer only with "NO" and nothing else

RESPONSE
get_all_code_smells

Purpose of external services:
- get_all_code_smells: This service is used to retrieve a list of code smells from a database.
