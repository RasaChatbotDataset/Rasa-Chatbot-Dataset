Problem: This is a python actions.py file of Rasa chatbot from typing import Any, Text, Dict, List

from rasa_sdk import Action, Tracker
from rasa_sdk.executor import CollectingDispatcher
from actions.firebase_controller.firebase_controller import FirebaseController
from actions.firebase_controller.icontroller import states_prompts_templates , AvailableDeviceTypes
from actions.firebase_controller.ask_llm import AskLlm

class ActionFallBackToLlm(Action):

    def name(self) -> Text:
        return "action_fallback_to_llm"

    def run(self, dispatcher: CollectingDispatcher,
            tracker: Tracker,
            domain: Dict[Text, Any]) -> List[Dict[Text, Any]]:
        
        controller = FirebaseController.instance()
        ask_llm = AskLlm(tracker=tracker)

        states = controller.getDevicesStates()

        state_prompts = ""
        for i , state in enumerate(states):
            if state == None:
                continue

            device_type_id = controller.metadata[i]["device_type_id"]
            if device_type_id != AvailableDeviceTypes.POWER_CONSUMPTION:
                state_prompts += states_prompts_templates[device_type_id](state , controller.metadata[i]) + "\n"

        answer = ask_llm.ask_llm_general_conversation(state_prompts)

        dispatcher.utter_message(text= answer)
        return []
        # dispatcher.utter_message(text= "This is test")
        # return [] 
        Does the chatbot use any database (local or external) or any external service? Answer with a list of these databases and services (only names on a single line, no further explanation, no numeration). 
        
    For this problem I received these answers, each with a list of services:
    Firebase, AskLlm
Firebase, AskLlm
Firebase
Firebase, AskLlm
Firebase, AskLlm
Firebase, AskLlm
Firebase, AskLlm
Firebase, AskLlm
Firebase, AskLlm
Firebase, AskLlm
    Basing on these answers and on the action file written in the problem, write one complete and correct list of the external services used in this action file. Keep in mind that some answers may have incorrect terms which are not external services or databases (like libraries that are not external services, or services that do not exist) and you have to remove them. 
    Different answers may refer to the same service with different names, and there could be missing services that you have to add.
    Write this list of service names on a single line, with no introduction, further explanation or numeration, so like this:
    Service1, Service2, Service3 
    In a new section titled "Purpose of external services" explain the purpose of each service.
    If the file doesn't use any external service nor database, answer only with "NO" and nothing else

RESPONSE
Firebase, AskLlm

Purpose of external services:
- Firebase: Used to retrieve device states and metadata.
- AskLlm: Used to generate responses based on the device states and metadata.
