The behavior of an individual as a unit of society or a community has marked effects on the dynamics of a pandemic that involves the level of severity, degree of flow, and after effects.Isolation, social distancing, and closure of educational institutes, workplaces, and entertainment venues consigned people to stay in their homes to help break the chain of transmission. However, the restrictive measures undoubtedly have affected the social and mental health of individuals from across the board. Our website Advika is not just a website but a whole package having various attractive features that not only help the user to work on their mental health but also helps in raising awareness and also lending a helping hand to those in need.
