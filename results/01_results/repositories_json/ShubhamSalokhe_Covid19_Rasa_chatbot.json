Every website uses a Chatbot to interact with the users and help them out. This has proven to reduce the time and resources used to a great extent. The coronavirus outbreak has significant consequences for society worldwide. People are rightly concerned and have many urgent questions. The World Health Organization provides answers to frequently asked questions regarding the coronavirus. However, you may have to search for a while before finding the correct answer to your question. People must be well informed about current measures. This way, we can efficiently limit the mass spread and achieve herd immunity. A chatbot could ideally help with this! This chatbot is developed using RASA (Receive, Appreciate, Summarize, Ask) Framework and NLP (Natural Language Processing}.
